Plant J	Integration of danger peptide signals with HAMP signaling amplifies the anti-herbivore defense responses in rice.	2018	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki, Okayama, 710-0046, Japan.	Plant defense against herbivores is modulated by herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) from oral secretions (OS) and/or saliva of insects. Furthermore, feeding wounds initiate plant's self-damage responses modulated by danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) such as immune defense-promoting plant elicitor peptides (Peps). While temporal and spatial co-existence of both patterns during herbivory implies a possibility of their close interactions, molecular mechanisms remain undetermined. Here, we report that exogenous application of rice (Oryza sativa) peptides (OsPeps) can elicit multiple defense responses in rice cell cultures. Specific activation of OsPROPEP3 gene transcripts in rice leaves by wounding and OS treatments further suggests a possible involvement of the OsPep3 peptide in rice-herbivore interactions. Correspondingly, we found that simultaneous application of OsPep3 to Mythimna loreyi OS significantly amplifies an array of defense responses in rice cells, including MAPK activation, and generation of defense-related hormones and metabolites. The OsPROPEP3/4 induction by OsPep3 points to a positive auto-feedback loop in OsPep signaling which may contribute to additional enhancement of defense signal(s). Finally, the overexpression of the OsPep receptor OsPEPR1 increases the sensitivity of rice plants not only to the cognate OsPeps but also OS signals. Our findings collectively suggest that HAMP-DAMP signal integration provides a critical step in the amplification of HAMP signaling during plant defense. This article is protected by copyright.
