The contamination of harvested grain with Fusarium mycotoxins is a threat to human and animal health. In wheat production of the toxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which inhibits eukaryotic protein biosynthesis, is a virulence factor of Fusarium, and resistance against DON is considered to be part of Fusarium resistance. Previously, single amino acid changes in RPL3 (ribosomal protein L3) conferring DON resistance have been described in yeast. The goal of this work was to characterize the RPL3 gene family from wheat and to investigate the potential role of naturally existing RPL3 alleles in DON resistance by comparing Fusarium-resistant and susceptible cultivars. The gene family consists of three homoeologous alleles of both RPL3A and RPL3B, which are located on chromosomes 4A (RPL3-B2), 4B (RPL3-B1), 4D (RPL3-B3), 5A (RPL3-A3), 5B (RPL3-A2) and 5D (RPL3-A1). Alternative splicing was detected in the TaRPL3-A2 gene. Sequence comparison revealed no amino acid differences between cultivars differing in Fusarium resistance. While using developed SNP markers we nevertheless found that one of the genes, namely, TaRPL3-A3 mapped close to a Fusarium resistance QTL (Qfhs.ifa-5A). The potential role of the RPL3 gene family in DON resistance of wheat is discussed.
