BMC Plant Biol	Identification, characterization, and transcription analysis of xylogen-like arabinogalactan proteins in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2014	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.	Xylogen, a chimeric arabinogalactan protein containing a non-specific lipid transfer protein domain, can promote xylem cell differentiation. No comprehensive study has been carried out on the XYLP gene family in rice. As a first step in research on this gene family and as a useful strategy in general, a genome-wide analysis of the OsXYLP gene family is thus needed.	RESULTS: In this study, we identified 21 XYLP genes from the rice genome and comprehensively analyzed their protein structures, phylogenetic relationships, chromosomal locations, and gene duplication status. Our results indicate that gene duplication has played major roles in the expansion of the OsXYLP gene family. We used expressed sequence tag, microarray, massively parallel signature sequencing, and quantitative real-time PCR data to analyze OsXYLP gene expression during various developmental stages and under abiotic stress conditions. We found that many OsXYLP genes are abundantly expressed in vascular tissues and seeds, with some genes regulated under hormonal or abiotic stresses. In addition, we identified knockout mutants of OsXYLP7 and OsXYLP16 and discovered that the mutant xylp7 has a defect in stem height. CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed expression profiles of 21 XYLP genes and characterized the structures and evolutionary relationships of their proteins. Our results demonstrate that the rice XYLP gene family may play roles in plant vascular system development and hormone signaling. Among the 21 detected OsXYLPs, 19 are newly identified genes encoding arabinogalactan proteins. Our results provide comprehensive insights that will assist future research on the biological functions of the rice XYLP gene family.
