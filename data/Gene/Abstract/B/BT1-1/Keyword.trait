OsBT1-1|OsBT1	grain	OsBT1 encodes an ADP-glucose transporter involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation in rice endosperm.	The osbt1 mutant showed a white-core endosperm and a significantly lower grain weight than the wild-type
OsBT1-1|OsBT1	development	OsBT1 encodes an ADP-glucose transporter involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation in rice endosperm.	The formation and development of compound starch granules in osbt1 was obviously defective: the amyloplast was disintegrated at early developmental stages and the starch granules were disperse and not compound in the endosperm cells in the centre region of osbt1 seeds
OsBT1-1|OsBT1	starch	OsBT1 encodes an ADP-glucose transporter involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation in rice endosperm.	OsBT1 encodes an ADP-glucose transporter involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation in rice endosperm.

OsBT1-1|OsBT1	starch	OsBT1 encodes an ADP-glucose transporter involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation in rice endosperm.	Furthermore, the expression of starch synthesis related genes was also altered in the osbt1 mutant
OsBT1-1|OsBT1	starch	OsBT1 encodes an ADP-glucose transporter involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation in rice endosperm.	These findings indicate that OsBT1 plays an important role in starch synthesis and the formation of compound starch granules
OsBT1-1|OsBT1	map-based cloning	OsBT1 encodes an ADP-glucose transporter involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation in rice endosperm.	Map-based cloning of OsBT1 indicated that it encodes a putatively ADP-glucose transporter
OsBT1-1|OsBT1	endosperm	OsBT1 encodes an ADP-glucose transporter involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation in rice endosperm.	The osbt1 mutant showed a white-core endosperm and a significantly lower grain weight than the wild-type

OsBT1-1|OsBT1	grain weight	OsBT1 encodes an ADP-glucose transporter involved in starch synthesis and compound granule formation in rice endosperm.	The osbt1 mutant showed a white-core endosperm and a significantly lower grain weight than the wild-type
OsBT1-1|OsBT1	seed	Rice OsBT1 regulates seed dormancy through the glycometabolism pathway.	Rice OsBT1 regulates seed dormancy through the glycometabolism pathway.
OsBT1-1|OsBT1	dormancy	Rice OsBT1 regulates seed dormancy through the glycometabolism pathway.	Rice OsBT1 regulates seed dormancy through the glycometabolism pathway.
