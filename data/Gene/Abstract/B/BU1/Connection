BU1|OsbHLH174	D1|RGA1|LW5	BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1, encoding a helix-loop-helix protein, is a novel gene involved in brassinosteroid signaling and controls bending of the lamina joint in rice	In addition, compared to the wild type, the induction of BU1 by exogenous brassinolide did not require de novo protein synthesis and it was weaker in a BR receptor mutant OsbriI (Oryza sativa brassinosteroid insensitive1, d61) and a rice G protein alpha subunit (RGA1) mutant d1
BU1|OsbHLH174	D1|RGA1|LW5	BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1, encoding a helix-loop-helix protein, is a novel gene involved in brassinosteroid signaling and controls bending of the lamina joint in rice	These results indicate that BU1 protein is a positive regulator of BR response: it controls bending of the lamina joint in rice and it is a novel primary response gene that participates in two BR signaling pathways through OsBRI1 and RGA1

BU1|OsbHLH174	MRG702	MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.	Gene transcription analyses showed that MRG702 knock-down resulted in the down-regulation of BR-related genes, including D11, BRI1, and BU1, and several flowering genes including Ehd1, Ehd2/OsID1/RID1, Ehd3,OsMADS50, Hd3a, and RFT1
BU1|OsbHLH174	RLI1	An SPX-RLI1 module regulates leaf inclination in response to phosphate availability in rice.	 RLI1 directly activates the downstream genes BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1) and BU1-LIKE 1 COMPLEX1 (BC1) to control elongation of the lamina joint cells, therefore enhancing leaf inclination
BU1|OsbHLH174	OsbHLH153	Genome-wide association studies reveal that members of bHLH subfamily 16 share a conserved function in regulating flag leaf angle in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Three candidates, OsbHLH153, OsbHLH173 and OsbHLH174, quickly responded to BR and IAA involved in plant architecture except for OsbHLH173, whose expression level was too low to be detected; their overexpression in plants increased rice leaf angle
