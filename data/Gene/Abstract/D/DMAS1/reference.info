10.1007-s11103-007-9262-8.pdf	Identification and localisation of the rice nicotianamine aminotransferase gene OsNAAT1 expression suggests the site of phytosiderophore synthesis in rice	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) take up iron using iron-chelating compounds known as mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs). In the biosynthetic pathway of MAs, nicotianamine aminotransferase (NAAT) catalyses the key step from nicotianamine to the 3''-keto form. In the present study, we identified six rice NAAT genes (OsNAAT1-6) by screening a cDNA library made from Fe-deficient rice roots and by searching databases. Among the NAAT homologues, OsNAAT1 belongs to a subgroup containing barley functional NAAT (HvNAAT-A and HvNAAT-B) as well as a maize homologue cloned by cDNA library screening (ZmNAAT1). Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis showed that OsNAAT1, but not OsNAAT2-6, was strongly up-regulated by Fe deficiency, both in roots and shoots. The OsNAAT1 protein had NAAT enzyme activity in vitro, confirming that the OsNAAT1 gene encodes functional NAAT. Promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsNAAT1 was expressed in companion and pericycle cells adjacent to the protoxylem of Fe-sufficient roots. In addition, expression was induced in all cells of Fe-deficient roots, with particularly strong GUS activity evident in the companion and pericycle cells. OsNAAT1 expression was also observed in the companion cells of Fe-sufficient shoots, and was clearly induced in all the cells of Fe-deficient leaves. These expression patterns highly resemble those of OsNAS1, OsNAS2 and OsDMAS1, the genes responsible for MAs biosynthesis for Fe acquisition. These findings strongly suggest that rice synthesizes MAs in whole Fe-deficient roots to acquire Fe from the rhizosphere, and also in phloem cells to maintain metal homeostasis facilitated by MAs-mediated long-distance transport.
Bashir-2006-Cloning and characte.pdf	Cloning and characterization of deoxymugineic acid synthase genes from graminaceous plants	2006	J Biol Chem	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657.	Graminaceous plants have evolved a unique mechanism to acquire iron through the secretion of a family of small molecules, called mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs). All MAs are synthesized from l-Met, sharing the same pathway from l-Met to 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA). DMA is synthesized through the reduction of a 3''-keto intermediate by deoxymugineic acid synthase (DMAS). We have isolated DMAS genes from rice (OsDMAS1), barley (HvDMAS1), wheat (TaD-MAS1), and maize (ZmDMAS1). Their nucleotide sequences indicate that OsDMAS1 encodes a predicted polypeptide of 318 amino acids, whereas the other three orthologs all encode predicted polypeptides of 314 amino acids and are highly homologous (82-97.5%) to each other. The DMAS proteins belong to the aldo-keto reductase superfamily 4 (AKR4) but do not fall within the existing subfamilies of AKR4 and appear to constitute a new subfamily within the AKR4 group. All of the proteins showed DMA synthesis activity in vitro. Their enzymatic activities were highest at pH 8-9, consistent with the hypothesis that DMA is synthesized in subcellular vesicles. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of each of the above DMAS genes is up-regulated under iron-deficient conditions in root tissue, and that of the genes OsDMAS1 and TaDMAS1 is up-regulated in shoot tissue. OsDMAS1 promoter-GUS analysis in iron-sufficient roots showed that its expression is restricted to cells participating in long distance transport and that it is highly up-regulated in the entire root under iron-deficient conditions. In shoot tissue, OsDMAS1 promoter drove expression in vascular bundles specifically under iron-deficient conditions.
J. Exp. Bot.-2013-Yang-5009-20.pdf	A receptor-like protein RMC is involved in regulation of iron acquisition in rice	2013	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, PR China.	Iron (Fe) is one of the essential mineral elements for plant growth and development. Acquisition of Fe by plants is mediated by a complex network involving Fe mobilization, uptake by root cells, and transport within plants. Here, we evaluated the role of a previously clarified gene encoding a receptor-like protein from rice, OsRMC, in the regulation of Fe acquisition by comparing Fe concentration, biomass, and expression patterns of genes associated with Fe mobilization and transport in wild-type (WT) rice with those in OsRMC overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown transgenic rice plants. Expression of OsRMC was upregulated in both shoots and roots upon exposure of WT to Fe-deficient medium. Expression levels of OsRMC were positively correlated with Fe concentration in rice plants under both Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient conditions such that overexpression and RNAi lines had higher and lower Fe concentration in both roots and shoots than WT plants, respectively. Moreover, overexpression of OsRMC conferred greater accumulation of Fe in mature seeds under Fe-sufficient conditions. OsRMC may also play a role in regulation of Fe deficiency-induced changes in root growth, as evidenced by greater and smaller root systems of OsRMC overexpression lines and RNAi lines than WT under Fe-deficient conditions, respectively. Several Fe deficiency-responsive genes including OsDMAS1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAAT1, OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsIRO2 were up- and downregulated in OsRMC-overexpressing and RNAi plants compared with WT rice plants. These novel findings highlight an important role of OsRMC played in mediation of Fe acquisition and root growth in rice, particularly under Fe-deficient conditions.
Kobayashi-2005-Expression of iron-a.pdf	Expression of iron-acquisition-related genes in iron-deficient rice is co-ordinately induced by partially conserved iron-deficiency-responsive elements	2005	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) utilize the iron chelators known as mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) to acquire iron from the rhizosphere. Synthesis of MAs and uptake of MA-chelated iron are strongly induced under conditions of iron deficiency. Microarray analysis was used to characterize the expression profile of rice in response to iron deficiency at the genomic level. mRNA extracted from iron-deficient or iron-sufficient rice roots or leaves was hybridized to a rice array containing 8987 cDNA clones. An induction ratio of greater than 2.0 in roots was observed for 57 genes, many of which are involved in iron-uptake mechanisms, including every identified or predicted step in the methionine cycle and the biosynthesis of MAs from methionine. Northern analysis confirmed that the expression of genes encoding every step in the methionine cycle is thoroughly induced by iron deficiency in roots, and almost thoroughly induced in leaves. A promoter search revealed that the iron-deficiency-induced genes related to iron uptake possessed sequences homologous to the iron-deficiency-responsive cis-acting elements IDE1 and IDE2 in their promoter regions, at a higher rate than that showing no induction under Fe deficiency. These results suggest that rice genes involved in iron acquisition are co-ordinately regulated by conserved mechanisms in response to iron deficiency, in which IDE-mediated regulation plays a significant role.
Nozoye-2007-The expression of ir.pdf	The expression of iron homeostasis-related genes during rice germination	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.	To characterize Fe homeostasis during the early stages of seed germination, a microarray analysis was performed. mRNAs extracted from fully mature seeds or seeds harvested 1-3 days after sowing were hybridized to a rice microarray containing approximately 22,000 cDNA oligo probes. Many Fe deficiency-inducible genes were strongly expressed throughout early seed germination. These results suggest that the demand for Fe is extremely high during germination. Under Fe-deficient conditions, rice produces and secretes a metal-cation chelator called deoxymugineic acid (DMA) to acquire Fe from the soil. In addition, DMA and its intermediate nicotianamine (NA) are thought to be involved in long distance Fe transport in rice. Using promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis, we investigated the expression patterns during seed germination of the Fe deficiency-inducible genes OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAS3, OsNAAT1, and OsDMAS1, which encode enzymes that participate in the biosynthesis of DMA, and the transporter genes OsYSL2 and OsIRT1, which are involved in Fe transport. All of these genes were expressed in germinating seeds prior to protrusion of the radicle. These results suggest that DMA and NA are produced and involved in Fe transport during germination.
pce2569.pdf	Identification of OsbHLH133 as a regulator of iron distribution between roots and shoots in Oryza sativa	2013	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry Joint Research Laboratory in Genomics and Nutriomics, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient element for plant growth. Regulation of Fe-deficiency signalling networks is one of the many functions reported for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors in plants. In the present study, OsbHLH133 was found to be induced by Fe-deficiency conditions in Oryza sativa. Insertional inactivation of OsbHLH133 (bhlh133) resulted in growth retardation, with enhanced Fe concentration seen in shoots, and reduced Fe concentration in roots. Overexpression of OsbHLH133 had the opposite effect, that is resulted in an enhanced Fe concentration in roots and reduced Fe concentration in shoots and also in xylem sap. Microarray analysis showed that some of the genes encoding Fe-related functions were up-regulated under Fe-sufficient conditions, in bhlh133 mutant plants compared to wild-type plants. Significant differential expression of a number of signalling pathways, including calcium signalling, was also seen in bhlh133 plants compared to wild-type plants, independent of Fe conditions.
Suzuki-2008-Deoxymugineic acid i.pdf	Deoxymugineic acid increases Zn translocation in Zn-deficient rice plants	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Global Agricultural Sciences, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Science, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Deoxymugineic acid (DMA) is a member of the mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs), which are natural metal chelators produced by graminaceous plants. Rice secretes DMA in response to Fe deficiency to take up Fe in the form of Fe(III)-MAs complex. In contrast with barley, the roots of which secrete MAs in response to Zn deficiency, the amount of DMA secreted by rice roots was slightly decreased under conditions of low Zn supply. There was a concomitant increase in endogenous DMA in rice shoots, suggesting that DMA plays a role in the translocation of Zn within Zn-deficient rice plants. The expression of OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 was not increased in Zn-deficient roots but that of OsNAS3 was increased in Zn-deficient roots and shoots. The expression of OsNAAT1 was also increased in Zn-deficient roots and dramatically increased in shoots; correspondingly, HPLC analysis was unable to detect nicotianamine in Zn-deficient shoots. The expression of OsDMAS1 was increased in Zn-deficient shoots. Analyses using the positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS) showed that Zn-deficient rice roots absorbed less (62)Zn-DMA than (62)Zn(2+). Importantly, supply of (62)Zn-DMA rather than (62)Zn(2+) increased the translocation of (62)Zn into the leaves of Zn-deficient plants. This was especially evident in the discrimination center (DC). These results suggest that DMA in Zn-deficient rice plants has an important role in the distribution of Zn within the plant rather than in the absorption of Zn from the soil.
NA	Paralogs and mutants show that one DMA synthase functions in Fe homeostasis in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa) secretes 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) to acquire insoluble iron (Fe) from the rhizosphere. In rice, DMA is synthesized by DMA synthase 1 (OsDMAS1), a member of the aldo-keto reductase super family. We screened OsDMAS1 paralogs for DMA synthesis. None of these paralogs displayed in vitro DMA synthesis activity, suggesting that rice only harbors one functional DMAS. We further characterized OsDMAS1 mutant plants. We failed to screen homozygous knock-out plants (dmas-1), so we characterized DMAS knock-down plants (dmas-kd1 and dmas-kd2). Under Fe-deficient conditions, dmas-kd1 plants were more chlorotic compared to the wild-type (WT) plants, and the expression of OsNAS3, OsYSL2, OsIRT1, and OsIRO2 was significantly up-regulated in the dmas-kd1 mutant, indicating that metal homeostasis was significantly disturbed. The secretion of DMA in dmas-kd1 was not significantly reduced. The dmas-kd1 plants accumulated less Fe in their roots compared to WT plants when grown with 10 ¦ÌM FeSO4. The dmas-kd1 plants accumulated more Zn in their roots compared to WT plants under Fe-deficient, Fe-EDTA, and FeSO4 conditions. In both dehusked rice seeds (brown rice) and polished rice, no differences were observed for Fe, Cu, or Mn accumulation, whereas dmas-kd1 seeds significantly accumulated more Zn in brown rice. Our data suggests that rice only harbors one functional gene for DMA synthesis. In addition, the knock-down of OsDMAS1 significantly up-regulates the genes involved in Fe uptake and homeostasis.
