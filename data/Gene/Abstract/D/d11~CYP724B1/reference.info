Methylation of histone lysine residues plays an essential role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Enzymes involved in establishment of the repressive H3K9 and H3K27 methylation marks have been previously characterized, but the deposition and function of H3K4 and H3K36 methylation remain uncharacterized in rice. Here, we report that rice SDG725 encodes a H3K36 methyltransferase, and its down-regulation causes wide-ranging defects, including dwarfism, shortened internodes, erect leaves and small seeds. These defects resemble the phenotypes previously described for some brassinosteroid-knockdown mutants. Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that levels of H3K36me2/3 are reduced in chromatin at some regions of these brassinosteroid-related genes in SDG725 knockdown plants, and that SDG725 protein is able to directly bind to these target genes. Taken together, our data indicate that SDG725-mediated H3K36 methylation modulates brassinosteroid-related gene expression, playing an important role in rice plant growth and development.
nbt1173.pdf	Erect leaves caused by brassinosteroid deficiency increase biomass production and grain yield in rice	2006	Nat Biotechnol	Field Production Science Center, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Midoricho, Nishi-Tokyo, Tokyo 188-0002, Japan. orchardist@fm.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp	New cultivars with very erect leaves, which increase light capture for photosynthesis and nitrogen storage for grain filling, may have increased grain yields. Here we show that the erect leaf phenotype of a rice brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, osdwarf4-1, is associated with enhanced grain yields under conditions of dense planting, even without extra fertilizer. Molecular and biochemical studies reveal that two different cytochrome P450s, CYP90B2/OsDWARF4 and CYP724B1/D11, function redundantly in C-22 hydroxylation, the rate-limiting step of brassinosteroid biosynthesis. Therefore, despite the central role of brassinosteroids in plant growth and development, mutation of OsDWARF4 alone causes only limited defects in brassinosteroid biosynthesis and plant morphology. These results suggest that regulated genetic modulation of brassinosteroid biosynthesis can improve crops without the negative environmental effects of fertilizers.
Plant Cell-2005-Tanabe-776-90.pdf	A novel cytochrome P450 is implicated in brassinosteroid biosynthesis via the characterization of a rice dwarf mutant, dwarf11, with reduced seed length	2005	Plant Cell	Fukui Prefectural University, Faculty of Bioscience, Kenjyojima, Matsuoka-cho, Yoshida-gun, Fukui 910-1195, Japan.	We have characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf11 (d11), that bears seeds of reduced length. To understand the mechanism by which seed length is regulated, the D11 gene was isolated by a map-based cloning method. The gene was found to encode a novel cytochrome P450 (CYP724B1), which showed homology to enzymes involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis. The dwarf phenotype of d11 mutants was restored by the application of the brassinolide (BL). Compared with wild-type plants, the aberrant D11 mRNA accumulated at higher levels in d11 mutants and was dramatically reduced by treatment with BL, implying that the gene is feedback-regulated by BL. Precise determination of the defective step(s) in BR synthesis in d11 mutants proved intractable because of tissue specificity and the complex control of BR accumulation in plants. However, 6-deoxotyphasterol (6-DeoxoTY) and typhasterol (TY), but not any upstream intermediates before these compounds, effectively restored BR response in d11 mutants in a lamina joint bending assay. Multiple lines of evidence together suggest that the D11/CYP724B1 gene plays a role in BR synthesis and may be involved in the supply of 6-DeoxoTY and TY in the BR biosynthesis network in rice.
Plant Cell-2010-Je-1777-91.pdf	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice	2010	Plant Cell	Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Program), Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Environmental Biotechnology National Core Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Korea.	Temporal and spatial variation in the levels of and sensitivity to hormones are essential for the development of higher organisms. Traditionally, end-product feedback regulation has been considered as the key mechanism for the achievement of cellular homeostasis. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that are perceived by the cell surface receptor kinase Brassinosteroid Insensitive1. Binding of these hormones to the receptor activates BR signaling and eventually suppresses BR synthesis. This report shows that RAVL1 regulates the expression of the BR receptor. Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback. Activation by RAVL1 was coordinated via E-box cis-elements in the promoters of the receptor and biosynthetic genes. Also, RAVL1 is necessary for the response of these genes to changes in cellular BR homeostasis. Genetic evidence is presented to strengthen the observation that the primary action of RAVL1 mediates the expression of genes involved in BR signaling and biosynthesis. This study thus describes a regulatory circuit modulating the homeostasis of BR in which RAVL1 ensures the basal activity of both the signaling and the biosynthetic pathways.
NA	CLUSTERED PRIMARY BRANCH 1, a new allele of DWARF11, controls panicle architecture and seed size in rice.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, National Center for Evaluation of Agricultural Wild Plants (Rice), Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	Panicle architecture and seed size are important agronomic traits that directly determine grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Although a number of key genes controlling panicle architecture and seed size have been cloned and characterized in recent years, their genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we identified a mutant that produced panicles with fascicled primary branching and reduced seeds in size. We isolated the underlying CLUSTERED PRIMARY BRANCH 1 (CPB1) gene, a new allele of DWARF11 (D11) encoding a cytochrome P450 protein involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis pathway. Genetic transformation experiments confirmed that a His360Leu amino acid substitution residing in the highly conserved region of CPB1/D11 was responsible for the panicle architecture and seed size changes in the cpb1 mutants. Overexpression of CPB1/D11 under the background of cpb1 mutant not only rescued normal panicle architecture and plant height, but also had a larger leaf angle and seed size than the controls. Furthermore, the CPB1/D11 transgenic plants driven by panicle-specific promoters can enlarge seed size and enhance grain yield without affecting other favourable agronomic traits. These results demonstrated that the specific mutation in CPB1/D11 influenced development of panicle architecture and seed size, and manipulation of CPB1/D11 expression using the panicle-specific promoter could be used to increase seed size, leading to grain yield improvement in rice.
NA	GNS4, a novel allele of DWARF11, regulates grain number and grain size in a high-yield rice variety.	2017	Rice (N Y)	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of the Ministry of Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China.	Rice plays an extremely important role in food safety because it feeds more than half of the world's population. Rice grain yield depends on biomass and the harvest index. An important strategy to break through the rice grain yield ceiling is to increase the biological yield. Therefore, genes associated with organ size are important targets for rice breeding.We characterized a rice mutant gns4 (grain number and size on chromosome 4) with reduced organ size, fewer grains per panicle, and smaller grains compared with those of WT. Map-based cloning indicated that the GNS4 gene, encoding a cytochrome P450 protein, is a novel allele of DWARF11 (D11). A single nucleotide polymorphism (deletion) in the promoter region of GNS4 reduced its expression level in the mutant, leading to reduced grain number and smaller grains. Morphological and cellular analyses suggested that GNS4 positively regulates grain size by promoting cell elongation. Overexpression of GNS4 significantly increased organ size, 1000-grain weight, and panicle size, and subsequently enhanced grain yields in both the Nipponbare and Wuyunjing7 (a high-yielding cultivar) backgrounds. These results suggest that GNS4 is key target gene with possible applications in rice yield breeding.GNS4 was identified as a positive regulator of grain number and grain size in rice. Increasing the expression level of this gene in a high-yielding rice variety enhanced grain yield. GNS4 can be targeted in breeding programs to increase yields.
NA	Panicle Morphology Mutant 1 (PMM1) determines the inflorescence architecture of rice by controlling brassinosteroid biosynthesis.	2018	BMC Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Panicle architecture is one of the main important agronomical traits that determine branch number and grain number in rice. Although a large number of genes involved in panicle development have been identified in recent years, the complex processes of inflorescence patterning need to be further characterized in rice. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid phytohormones. A great understanding of how BRs contribute to plant height and leaf erectness have been reported, however, the molecular and genetic mechanisms of panicle architecture influenced by BRs remain unclear.Here, we identified PMM1, encoding a cytochrome P450 protein involved in BRs biosynthesis, and characterized its role in panicle architecture in rice. Three alleles of pmm1 were identified from our T-DNA insertional mutant library. Map-based cloning revealed that a large fragment deletion from the 2nd to 9th exons of PMM1 was responsible for the clustered primary branch morphology in pmm1-1. PMM1 is a new allele of DWARF11 (D11) PMM1 transcripts are preferentially expressed in young panicles, particularly expressed in the primordia of branches and spikelets during inflorescence development. Furthermore, overexpression of OsDWARF4 (D4), another gene encoding cytochrome P450, completely rescued the abnormal panicle phenotype of pmm1-1. Overall, it can be concluded that PMM1 is an important gene involved in BRs biosynthesis and affecting the differentiation of spikelet primordia and patterns of panicle branches in rice.PMM1 is a new allele of D11, which encodes a cytochrome P450 protein involved in BRs biosynthesis pathway. Overexpression of D4 could successfully rescue the abnormal panicle architecture of pmm1 plants, indicating that PMM1/D11 and D4 function redundantly in BRs biosynthesis. Thus, our results demonstrated that PMM1 determines the inflorescence architecture by controlling brassinosteroid biosynthesis in rice.
NA	Notched Belly Grain 4, a Novel Allele of Dwarf 11, Regulates Grain Shape and Seed Germination in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2018	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Lab of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 311400, China. tongxiaohong@caas.cn.	Notched belly grain (NBG) is a type of deformed grain shape that has been associated with inferior appearance and tastes in rice. NBG is coordinated by both environments and genetics. In this study, we report on the first map-based cloning of an NBG gene on chromosome 4, denoted NBG4, which is a novel allele of Dwarf 11 encoding a cytochrome P450 (CYP724B1) involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis. A 10-bp deletion in the 7th exon knocked down the level of the NBG4 transcript and shifted the reading frame of the resulting protein. In addition to the dwarf and clustered panicle as previously reported in the allelic mutants, nbg4 grains also displayed retarded germination and NBG due to the physical constraint of deformed hulls caused by abnormal hull elongation. NBG4 is constitutively expressed with the highest level of expression in immature inflorescences. In all, 2294 genes were differentially expressed in nbg4 and wild-type (WT), and evidence is presented that NBG4 regulates OsPPS-2, OsPRA2, OsYUCCA1, sped1-D, and Dwarf that play critical roles in determining plant architecture, panicle development, and seed germination. This study demonstrated that NBG4 is a key node in the brassinosteroid-mediated regulation of rice grain shape.
