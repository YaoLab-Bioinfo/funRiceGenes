1-s2.0-S0981942812003476-main.pdf	Rice heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit (RGA1): in silico analysis of the gene and promoter and its upregulation under abiotic stress	2013	Plant Physiol Biochem	Plant Molecular Biology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi 110067, India.	Heterotrimeric G-protein complexes (Galpha, Gbeta and Ggamma) operate at the apex of diverse signal transduction systems along with their cognate transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and appropriate downstream effectors in the plant. Rice Galpha in response to stress has not been well studied. Here, we report the in silico analysis of Galpha subunit from Oryza sativa cv. Indica group Swarna [RGA1(I), accession number HQ634688], its promoter and its transcript upregulation in response to abiotic stresses. Genomic sequence of RGA1(I) contains thirteen exonic and twelve intronic segments. Phylogenetic analysis of RGA1(I) demonstrated high homology with Sorghum and maize and is distantly related to barley and wheat. Promoter sequence analysis of RGA1(I) confirms the presence of stress-related cis-regulatory elements viz. ABA, MeJAE, ARE, GT-1 boxes and LTR suggesting its active and possible independent roles in abiotic stress signalling. Expasy PROSITE database of protein families and domains revealed important motifs, patterns and biologically significant sites in RGA1(I). Three dimensional structure of RGA1(I) protein predicted by I-TASSER server and its stereochemical qualities were validated by PROCHECK and QMEAN server indicating the acceptability of the predicted model. The transcript profiling of RGA1(I) showed upregulation following NaCl, cold and drought stress. Under elevated temperature, its transcript was down regulated. Heavy metal(loid)s stress showed rhythmic and strong upregulation. It showed a rhythmic response in ABA stress. These findings provide a critical evidence for its active role in regulation of abiotic stresses in rice. These findings suggest its possible exploitation in the development of abiotic stress tolerance in crops.
10.1007-BF00020885.pdf	Molecular cloning and characterization of RGA1 encoding a G protein alpha subunit from rice (Oryza sativa L. IR-36)	1995	Plant Mol Biol	Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Chinju, Korea.	A cDNA clone, RGA1, was isolated by using a GPA1 cDNA clone of Arabidopsis thaliana G protein alpha subunit as a probe from a rice (Oryza sativa L. IR-36) seedling cDNA library from roots and leaves. Sequence analysis of genomic clone reveals that the RGA1 gene has 14 exons and 13 introns, and encodes a polypeptide of 380 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 44.5 kDa. The encoded protein exhibits a considerable degree of amino acid sequence similarity to all the other known G protein alpha subunits. A putative TATA sequence (ATATGA), a potential CAAT box sequence (AGCAATAC), and a cis-acting element, CCACGTGG (ABRE), known to be involved in ABA induction are found in the promoter region. The RGA1 protein contains all the consensus regions of G protein alpha subunits except the cysteine residue near the C-terminus for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin. The RGA1 polypeptide expressed in Escherichia coli was, however, ADP-ribosylated by 10 microM [adenylate-32P] NAD and activated cholera toxin. Southern analysis indicates that there are no other genes similar to the RGA1 gene in the rice genome. Northern analysis reveals that the RGA1 mRNA is 1.85 kb long and expressed in vegetative tissues, including leaves and roots, and that its expression is regulated by light.
7310111a.pdf	Heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit is involved in rice brassinosteroid response	2006	Cell Res	Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanxincun 20, Xiangshan, Beijing 100093, China.	Heterotrimeric G proteins are known to function as messengers in numerous signal transduction pathways. The null mutation of RGA (rice heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit), which encodes the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G protein in rice, causes severe dwarfism and reduced responsiveness to gibberellic acid in rice. However, less is known about heterotrimeric G protein in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling, one of the well-understood phytohormone pathways. In the present study, we used root elongation inhibition assay, lamina inclination assay and coleoptile elongation analysis to demonstrated reduced sensitivity of d1 mutant plants (caused by the null mutation of RGA) to 24-epibrassinolide (24-epiBL), which belongs to brassinosteroids and plays a wide variety of roles in plant growth and development. Moreover, RGA transcript level was decreased in 24-epiBL-treated seedlings in a dose-dependent manner. Our results show that RGA is involved in rice brassinosteroid response, which may be beneficial to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of G protein signaling and provide a novel perspective to understand BR signaling in higher plants.
84_35.pdf	Study of novel d1 alleles, defective mutants of the Î± subunit of heterotrimeric G-protein in rice	2009	Genes Genet Syst	Department of Bioscience, Fukui Prefectural University	It has been shown that the disruption of the Î±-subunit gene of heterotorimeric G-proteins (GÎ±) results in dwarf traits, the erection of leaves and the setting of small seeds in rice. These mutants are called d1. We have studied the expression profiles of the transcripts and translation products of rice GÎ± in ten alleles of d1 including five additional alleles newly identified. By RT-PCR, the transcripts of the GÎ± gene were detected in the all d1 alleles. By western blot, the GÎ± proteins were not detected in the plasma membrane fractions of the d1 alleles with the exception of d1-4. In d1-4, one amino acid change in the GTP-binding box A of the GÎ± protein was occurred and even in this case the GÎ± protein was only just detectable in the plasma membrane fraction. Given that the GÎ± protein did not accumulate in the plasma membrane fraction in d1-8 which has a deletion of just a single amino acid in the GÎ± protein, it is likely that a proper conformation of the GÎ± is necessary for accumulation of GÎ± protein in the plasma membrane. Nine alleles of d1 showed a severer phenotype whilst d1-4 exhibited a mild phenotype with respect to seed size and elongation pattern of internodes. As brassinosteroid signaling was known to be partially impaired in d1s, the sensitivity to 24-epibrassinolide (24-epiBL) was compared among d1 alleles in a T65 genetic background. Only d1-4 showed responses similar to wild type rice. The results show that the d1-4 mutant is a mild allele in terms of the phenotype and mild hyposensitivity to the exogenously applied 24-epiBL.
j.1365-313X.2011.04643.x.pdf	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions	2011	Plant J	Department of Bioscience, Fukui Prefectural University, 4-1-1 Matsuoka Kenjyojima, Eiheiji-cho, Yoshida-gun, Fukui 910-1195, Japan.	In the present study, we investigated the function of the heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit (Gbeta) gene (RGB1) in rice. RGB1 knock-down lines were generated in the wild type and d1-5, a mutant deficient for the heterotrimeric G protein alpha-subunit (Galpha) gene (RGA1). Both transgenic lines showed browning of the lamina joint regions and nodes that could be attributed to a reduction of RGB1 function, as the abnormality was not observed in d1-5. The RGB1 knock-down lines generated in d1-5 were shorter, suggesting RGB1 to be a positive regulator of cellular proliferation, in addition to RGA1. The number of sterile seeds also increased in both RGB1 knock-down lines. These results suggest that Gbetagamma and Galpha cooperatively function in cellular proliferation and seed fertility. We discuss the potential predominant role of RGB1 in G protein signaling in rice.
journal.pgen.1003391.pdf	The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TUD1 functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice	2013	PLoS Genet	State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Beijing, China.	Heterotrimeric G proteins are an important group of signaling molecules found in eukaryotes. They function with G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs) to transduce various signals such as steroid hormones in animals. Nevertheless, their functions in plants are not well-defined. Previous studies suggested that the heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit known as D1/RGA1 in rice is involved in a phytohormone gibberellin-mediated signaling pathway. Evidence also implicates D1 in the action of a second phytohormone Brassinosteroid (BR) and its pathway. However, it is unclear how D1 functions in this pathway, because so far no partner has been identified to act with D1. In this study, we report a D1 genetic interactor Taihu Dwarf1 (TUD1) that encodes a functional U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase. Genetic, phenotypic, and physiological analyses have shown that tud1 is epistatic to d1 and is less sensitive to BR treatment. Histological observations showed that the dwarf phenotype of tud1 is mainly due to decreased cell proliferation and disorganized cell files in aerial organs. Furthermore, we found that D1 directly interacts with TUD1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that D1 and TUD1 act together to mediate a BR-signaling pathway. This supports the idea that a D1-mediated BR signaling pathway occurs in rice to affect plant growth and development.
Plant Cell Physiol-2010-Izawa-271-81.pdf	Function and expression pattern of the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein in rice	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Bioscience, Fukui Prefectural University, 4-1-1 Matsuoka Kenjyojima, Eiheiji-cho, Yoshida-gun, Fukui, 910-1195 Japan.	The d1 mutant, which is deficient for the heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit (Galpha) gene of rice, shows dwarfism and sets small round seeds. To determine whether dwarfism in d1 is due to a reduction in cell number or to shortened cell length, the cell number of the leaf sheath, the internode, the root and the lemma was compared between Nipponbare, a wild-type rice and d1-5, a d1 allele derived from Nipponbare. Our results indicate that the cell number was reduced in all organs analyzed in d1-5. In addition, cell enlargement was found in roots and lemma of d1-5, although the organ length in d1-5 was shorter than that of wild-type rice. These results suggest that rice Galpha participates in cell proliferation in rice. Western blot analyses using anti-Galpha antibody and RT-PCR analyses indicate that Galpha is mostly expressed in the developing organs. Galpha promoter activity studies using the GUS reporter gene confirmed that the expression of Galpha was highest in developing organs. We conclude that rice Galpha participates in the regulation of cell number in a developmental stage-dependent manner.
Plant Physiol.-2009-Steffens-732-40.pdf	Heterotrimeric G protein signaling is required for epidermal cell death in rice	2009	Plant Physiol	Physiologie und Entwicklungsbiologie der Pflanzen, Botanisches Institut, Universitat Kiel, 24118 Kiel, Germany.	In rice (Oryza sativa) adventitious root primordia are formed at the nodes as part of normal development. Upon submergence of rice plants, adventitious roots emerge from the nodes preceded by death of epidermal cells above the root primordia. Cell death is induced by ethylene and mediated by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Pharmacological experiments indicated that epidermal cell death was dependent on signaling through G proteins. Treatment with GTP-gamma-S induced epidermal cell death, whereas GDP-beta-S partially inhibited ethylene-induced cell death. The dwarf1 (d1) mutant of rice has repressed expression of the Galpha subunit RGA1 of heterotrimeric G protein. In d1 plants, cell death in response to ethylene and H(2)O(2) was nearly completely abolished, indicating that signaling through Galpha is essential. Ethylene and H(2)O(2) were previously shown to alter gene expression in epidermal cells that undergo cell death. Transcriptional regulation was not generally affected in the d1 mutant, indicating that altered gene expression is not sufficient to trigger cell death in the absence of Galpha. Analysis of genes encoding proteins related to G protein signaling revealed that four small GTPase genes, two GTPase-activating protein genes, and one GDP dissociation inhibitor gene but not RGA1 were differentially expressed in epidermal cells above adventitious roots, indicating that Galpha activity is regulated posttranscriptionally.
Plant Physiol.-2009-Tanaka-669-80.pdf	BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1, encoding a helix-loop-helix protein, is a novel gene involved in brassinosteroid signaling and controls bending of the lamina joint in rice	2009	Plant Physiol	Disease Resistance Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan.	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are involved in many developmental processes and regulate many subsets of downstream genes throughout the plant kingdom. However, little is known about the BR signal transduction and response network in monocots. To identify novel BR-related genes in rice (Oryza sativa), we monitored the transcriptomic response of the brassinosteroid deficient1 (brd1) mutant, with a defective BR biosynthetic gene, to brassinolide treatment. Here, we describe a novel BR-induced rice gene BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1), encoding a helix-loop-helix protein. Rice plants overexpressing BU1 (BU1:OX) showed enhanced bending of the lamina joint, increased grain size, and resistance to brassinazole, an inhibitor of BR biosynthesis. In contrast to BU1:OX, RNAi plants designed to repress both BU1 and its homologs displayed erect leaves. In addition, compared to the wild type, the induction of BU1 by exogenous brassinolide did not require de novo protein synthesis and it was weaker in a BR receptor mutant OsbriI (Oryza sativa brassinosteroid insensitive1, d61) and a rice G protein alpha subunit (RGA1) mutant d1. These results indicate that BU1 protein is a positive regulator of BR response: it controls bending of the lamina joint in rice and it is a novel primary response gene that participates in two BR signaling pathways through OsBRI1 and RGA1. Furthermore, expression analyses showed that BU1 is expressed in several organs including lamina joint, phloem, and epithelial cells in embryos. These results indicate that BU1 may participate in some other unknown processes modulated by BR in rice.
PNAS-1999-Ashikari-10284-9.pdf	Rice gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant gene Dwarf1 encodes the alpha-subunit of GTP-binding protein	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Plant Breeding Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.	A rice Dwarf 1 gene was identified by using a map-based cloning strategy. Its recessive mutant allele confers a dwarf phenotype. Linkage analysis revealed that a cDNA encoding the alpha-subunit of GTP-binding protein cosegregated with d1 in 3,185 d1 segregants. Southern hybridization analysis with this cDNA as a probe showed different band patterns in several d1 mutant lines. In at least four independent d1 mutants, no gene transcript was observed by Northern hybridization analysis. Sequencing analysis revealed that an 833-bp deletion had occurred in one of the mutant alleles, which resulted in an inability to express GTP-binding protein. A transgenic d1 mutant with GTP-binding protein gene restored the normal phenotype. We conclude that the rice Dwarf 1 gene encodes GTP-binding protein and that the protein plays an important role in plant growth and development. Because the d1 mutant is classified as gibberellin-insensitive, we suggest that the GTP-binding protein might be associated with gibberellin signal transduction.
PNAS-2000-Ueguchi-Tanaka-11638-43.pdf	Rice dwarf mutantd1, which is defective in the a subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, affects gibberellin signal transduction	2000	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Bioscience Center and Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya, 464-8601, Japan.	Previously, we reported that the rice dwarf mutant, d1, is defective in the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein (Galpha). In the present study, gibberellin (GA) signaling in d1 and the role of the Galpha protein in the GA-signaling pathway were investigated. Compared with the wild type, GA induction of alpha-amylase activity in aleurone cells of d1 was greatly reduced. Relative to the wild type, the GA(3)-treated aleurone layer of d1 had lower expression of Ramy1A, which encodes alpha-amylase, and OsGAMYB, which encodes a GA-inducible transcriptional factor, and no increase in expression of Ca(2 +)-ATPase. However, in the presence of high GA concentrations, alpha-amylase induction occurred even in d1. The GA sensitivity of second leaf sheath elongation in d1 was similar to that of the wild type in terms of dose responsiveness, but the response of internode elongation to GA was much lower in d1. Furthermore, Os20ox expression was up-regulated, and the GA content was elevated in the stunted internodes of d1. All these results suggest that d1 affects a part of the GA-signaling pathway, namely the induction of alpha-amylase in the aleurone layer and internode elongation. In addition, a double mutant between d1 and another GA-signaling mutant, slr, revealed that SLR is epistatic to the D1, supporting that the Galpha protein is involved in GA signaling. However, the data also provide evidence for the presence of an alternative GA-signaling pathway that does not involve the Galpha protein. It is proposed that GA signaling via the Galpha protein may be more sensitive than that of the alternative pathway, as indicated by the low GA responsiveness of this Galpha-independent pathway.
PNAS-2009-Miura-11218-23.pdf	A metastable DWARF1 epigenetic mutant affecting plant stature in rice	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	Epigenetic mutations confer heritable changes in gene expression that are not due to changes in the underlying sequence of the DNA. We identified a spontaneous rice mutant, Epi-d1, that shows a metastable dwarf phenotype. The phenotype is mitotically and meiotically inheritable and corresponds to the metastable epigenetic silencing of the DWARF1 (D1) gene. The silenced state is correlated with repressive histone and DNA methylation marks in the D1 promoter region but is not associated with DNA sequence alterations. Compared with other known epigenetic silenced loci in plants such as paramutable maize alleles and silent Arabidopsis genes, the Epi-d1 silencing phenomenon shows a high level of bidirectional metastable mutability. Epigenetic alleles such as Epi-d1 could thus provide for rapid adaptation under selective conditions.
pq007575.pdf	Suppression of the heterotrimeric G protein causes abnormal morphology, including dwarfism, in rice	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Bioscience, Fukui Prefectural University, Fukui 910-1195, Japan.	Transgenic rice containing an antisense cDNA for the alpha subunit of rice heterotrimeric G protein produced little or no mRNA for the subunit and exhibited abnormal morphology, including dwarf traits and the setting of small seeds. In normal rice, the mRNA for the alpha subunit was abundant in the internodes and florets, the tissues closely related to abnormality in the dwarf transformants. The position of the alpha-subunit gene was mapped on rice chromosome 5 by mapping with the restriction fragment length polymorphism. The position was closely linked to the locus of a rice dwarf mutant, Daikoku dwarf (d-1), which is known to exhibit abnormal phenotypes similar to those of the transformants that suppressed the endogenous mRNA for the alpha subunit by antisense technology. Analysis of the cDNAs for the alpha subunits of five alleles of Daikoku dwarf (d-1), ID-1, DK22, DKT-1, DKT-2, and CM1361-1, showed that these dwarf mutants had mutated in the coding region of the alpha-subunit gene. These results show that the G protein functions in the formation of normal internodes and seeds in rice.
pq2002013307.pdf	The heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit acts upstream of the small GTPase Rac in disease resistance of rice	2002	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma 630-0101, Japan.	We used rice dwarf1 (d1) mutants lacking a single-copy Galpha gene and addressed Galpha's role in disease resistance. d1 mutants exhibited a highly reduced hypersensitive response to infection by an avirulent race of rice blast. Activation of PR gene expression in the leaves of the mutants infected with rice blast was delayed for 24 h relative to the wild type. H(2)O(2) production and PR gene expression induced by sphingolipid elicitors (SE) were strongly suppressed in d1 cell cultures. Expression of the constitutively active OsRac1, a small GTPase Rac of rice, in d1 mutants restored SE-dependent defense signaling and resistance to rice blast. Galpha mRNA was induced by an avirulent race of rice blast and SE application on the leaf. These results indicated the role of Galpha in R gene-mediated disease resistance of rice. We have proposed a model for the defense signaling of rice in which the heterotrimeric G protein functions upstream of the small GTPase OsRac1 in the early steps of signaling.
NA	The Î±-subunit of the rice heterotrimeric G protein, RGA1, regulates drought tolerance during the vegetative phase in the dwarf rice mutant d1.	2016	J Exp Bot	Biology Department, Penn State University, 208 Mueller Laboratory, University Park, PA 16802, USA.	Essential in the Green Revolution was the development of high-yielding dwarf varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L.), but their selection was not based on responses to water limitation. We studied physiological responses to progressive drought of the dwarf rice mutant, d1, in which the RGA1 gene, which encodes the GTP-binding Î±-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, is non-functional. Wild-type (WT) plants cease net carbon fixation 11 days after water is withheld, while d1 plants maintain net photosynthesis for an additional week. During drought, d1 plants exhibit greater stomatal conductance than the WT, but both genotypes exhibit the same transpirational water loss per unit leaf area. This is explained by a smaller driving force for water loss in d1 owing to its lower leaf temperatures, consistent with its more erect architecture. As drought becomes more severe, WT plants show an accelerated decline in photosynthesis, which may be exacerbated by the higher leaf temperatures in the WT. We thus show how a rice mutant with dwarf and erect leaves has a decreased susceptibility to water stress. Accordingly, it may be useful to incorporate RGA1 mutation in breeding or biotechnological strategies for development of drought-resistant rice.
NA	Illuminating the role of the G¦Á heterotrimeric G protein subunit, RGA1, in regulating photoprotection and photovoidance in rice.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Biology Department, Penn State University, 208 Mueller Laboratory, University Park, PA, 16802, USA.	We studied physiological mechanisms of photoavoidance and photoprotection of a dwarf rice mutant with erect leaves, d1, in which the RGA1 gene, which encodes the G¦Á subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, is non-functional. d1 leaves exhibit lower leaf temperature and higher Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) relative to wild-type (WT), indicative of increased photoavoidance and more efficient light harvesting. RNA-seq analysis of flag leaves revealed that mRNA levels of genes encoding HSPs, enzymes associated with chlorophyll breakdown, and ROS scavengers were down-regulated in d1. By contrast, genes encoding proteins associated with light harvesting, PSII, cyclic electron transport, PSI, and chlorophyll biosynthesis were up-regulated in d1. Consistent with these observations, when WT and d1 plants were experimentally subjected to the same light intensity, d1 plants exhibited a greater capacity to dissipate excess irradiance (increased non-photochemical quenching) relative to WT. The increased capacity in d1 for both photoavoidance and photoprotection reduced sustained photoinhibitory damage, as revealed by a higher Fv /Fm . We therefore propose RGA1 as a regulator of photoavoidance and photoprotection mechanisms in rice and highlight the prospect of exploiting modulation of heterotrimeric G protein signaling to increase these characteristics and improve the yield of cereals in the event of abiotic stress. Reduced photoinhibition via increased photoavoidance and photoprotection are agronomic traits of interest that impact both stress tolerance and yield. We have shown that null mutation of RGA1, encoding the canonical G¦Á subunit of the rice heterotrimeric G protein, improves photoavoidance and photoprotection and modulates the expression of related genes. This study highlights the potential of manipulation of G-protein signaling for agronomic purposes.
NA	Proteomic Analysis of a Rice Mutant sd58 Possessing a Novel d1 Allele of Heterotrimeric G Protein Alpha Subunit (RGA1) in Salt Stress with a Focus on ROS Scavenging.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China. sxndpp@163.com.	High salinity severely restrains plant growth and results in decrease of crop yield in agricultural production. Thus, it is of great significance to discover the crucial regulators involved in plant salt resistance. Here, we report a novel mutant, sd58, which displays enhanced salt tolerance and dwarf phenotype, by screening from ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenized rice mutant library. Genetic analysis showed that sd58 was caused by a single recessive locus. Map-based cloning and allelic test revealed that the phenotypes of sd58 were due to the mutation of RGA1, encoding the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G protein (G¦Á). A point mutation (G to A) was identified at the splicing site (GT-AG) of the first intron in RGA1, which gives rise to the generation of abnormal mRNA splicing forms. Furthermore, 332 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified by using an Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation(iTRAQ)-based proteomic technique from seedlings of sd58 and Kitaake in response to salt treatment. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed these proteins were mainly involved in regulation of the processes such as metabolic pathways, photosynthesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Under salt stress, sd58 displayed lower ROS accumulation than Kitaake, which is consistent with the higher enzyme activities involved in ROS scavenging. Taken together, we propose that RGA1 is one of the regulators in salt response partially through ROS scavenging, which might be helpful in elucidating salt tolerant mechanisms of heterotrimeric G protein in rice.
NA	Leaf width gene LW5/D1 affects plant architecture and yield in rice by regulating nitrogen utilization efficiency	2020	Plant Physiol Biochem	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China; College of Bioscience and Bioengineering, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, 330045, China.	Leaves are the primary structures responsible for photosynthesis, making leaf morphology one of the most important traits of rice plant architecture. Both plant architecture and nutrient utilization jointly affect rice yield, however, their molecular association is still poorly understood. We identified a rice mutant, leaf width 5 (lw5), that displayed small grains and wide leaves and possesses characteristics typical of a small "sink" and a large "source". Map-based cloning and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing indicated that LW5 affects both the plant architecture and yield. It is an allele of D1, encoding the rice G protein ¦Á subunit. The loss of LW5 functioning leads to an increase in the rate of photosynthesis, vascular bundles, and chlorophyll content. However, the grain-straw ratio and the rate of grain filling decreased significantly. The detection results of 15N-ammonium nitrate and an expression analysis of genes associated with nitrogen demonstrated that LW5 serves an important role in nitrate uptake and transport. LW5 affects plant architecture and grain size by regulating nitrogen transfer. These results provide a theoretical foundation for further research surrounding the molecular mechanism of "source-sink" balance in rice and suggest novel methods of molecular design for the cultivation of breeding super rice in ideal plant types.
