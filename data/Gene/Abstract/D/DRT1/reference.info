NA	Formin protein DRT1 affects gross morphology and chloroplast relocation in rice.	2022	Plant Physiol	College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, 310036, China.	Plant height and tiller number are two major factors determining plant architecture and yield. However, in rice (Oryza sativa), the regulatory mechanism of plant architecture remains to be elucidated. Here, we reported a recessive rice mutant presenting dwarf and reduced tillering phenotypes (drt1). Map-based cloning revealed that the phenotypes are caused by a single point mutation in DRT1, which encodes the Class I formin protein O. sativa formin homolog 13 (OsFH13), binds with F-actin, and promotes actin polymerization for microfilament organization. DRT1 protein localized on the plasma membrane (PM) and chloroplast (CP) outer envelope. DRT1 interacted with rice phototropin 2 (OsPHOT2), and the interaction was interrupted in drt1. Upon blue light stimulus, PM localized DRT1 and OsPHOT2 were translocated onto the CP membrane. Moreover, deficiency of DRT1 reduced OsPHOT2 internalization and OsPHOT2-mediated CP relocation. Our study suggests that rice formin protein DRT1/OsFH13 is necessary for plant morphology and CP relocation by modulating the actin-associated cytoskeleton network.
