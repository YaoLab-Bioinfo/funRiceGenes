DRUS1|FLR1	growth	The Rice Receptor-like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization in Reproductive Development.	A phenotypic comparison of mutants expressing different amounts of DRUS1 and 2 revealed that reproductive growth requires a threshold level of DRUS1/2 proteins
DRUS1|FLR1	reproductive	The Rice Receptor-like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization in Reproductive Development.	A phenotypic comparison of mutants expressing different amounts of DRUS1 and 2 revealed that reproductive growth requires a threshold level of DRUS1/2 proteins
DRUS1|FLR1	sugar	The Rice Receptor-like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization in Reproductive Development.	DRUS1 and 2 maintain cell viability by repressing protease-mediated cell degradation and likely by affecting sugar utilization or conversion
DRUS1|FLR1	reproductive growth	The Rice Receptor-like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization in Reproductive Development.	A phenotypic comparison of mutants expressing different amounts of DRUS1 and 2 revealed that reproductive growth requires a threshold level of DRUS1/2 proteins
DRUS1|FLR1	tillering	Two FERONIA-like receptor (FLR) genes are required to maintain architecture, fertility, and seed yield in rice	 We observed that both FLR1 and FLR2 were involved in tillering of rice, but at different levels
DRUS1|FLR1	development	Two FERONIA-like receptor (FLR) genes are required to maintain architecture, fertility, and seed yield in rice	 Interestingly, FLR1 and FLR2 showed different functions related to fertility, and FLR1 might be specifically involved in rice male gametophyte development
DRUS1|FLR1	yield	Two FERONIA-like receptor (FLR) genes are required to maintain architecture, fertility, and seed yield in rice	 In this study, we generated flr1 and flr2 T-DNA insertion null mutants and investigated potential role of FLRs in rice yield
DRUS1|FLR1	yield	Two FERONIA-like receptor (FLR) genes are required to maintain architecture, fertility, and seed yield in rice	 With these similar but different functions, we suggest that FLR1 and FLR2 might function in complementary ways to regulate the yield of rice
DRUS1|FLR1	development	Roles of FERONIA-like receptor genes in regulating grain size and quality in rice	 To elucidate the possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we found that FLR1 was constitutively expressed during endosperm development
DRUS1|FLR1	grain	Roles of FERONIA-like receptor genes in regulating grain size and quality in rice	 flr1 mutants had a higher cell number and an accelerated rate of grain filling compared to wild-type plants, which led to grains with greater widths
DRUS1|FLR1	grain	Roles of FERONIA-like receptor genes in regulating grain size and quality in rice	 A mechanism underlying the regulation of grain size by FLR1 is that FLR1 is associated with OsRac1 Rho-like GTPase, a positive regulator of grain size
DRUS1|FLR1	grain	Roles of FERONIA-like receptor genes in regulating grain size and quality in rice	 Regarding grain quality, the flr1 mutant had a higher percentage of chalkiness compared with wild-type plants, and seeds carrying mutations in flr3 and flr14 had endosperms with white floury cores
DRUS1|FLR1	starch	Roles of FERONIA-like receptor genes in regulating grain size and quality in rice	 RNA-seq analysis identified 2,367 genes that were differentially expressed in the flr1 mutant, including genes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism and carbon fixation
