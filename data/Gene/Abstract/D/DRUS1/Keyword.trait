DRUS1|FLR1	growth	The Rice Receptor-like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization in Reproductive Development.	A phenotypic comparison of mutants expressing different amounts of DRUS1 and 2 revealed that reproductive growth requires a threshold level of DRUS1/2 proteins
DRUS1|FLR1	reproductive	The Rice Receptor-like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization in Reproductive Development.	A phenotypic comparison of mutants expressing different amounts of DRUS1 and 2 revealed that reproductive growth requires a threshold level of DRUS1/2 proteins
DRUS1|FLR1	sugar	The Rice Receptor-like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization in Reproductive Development.	DRUS1 and 2 maintain cell viability by repressing protease-mediated cell degradation and likely by affecting sugar utilization or conversion
DRUS1|FLR1	reproductive growth	The Rice Receptor-like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization in Reproductive Development.	A phenotypic comparison of mutants expressing different amounts of DRUS1 and 2 revealed that reproductive growth requires a threshold level of DRUS1/2 proteins
