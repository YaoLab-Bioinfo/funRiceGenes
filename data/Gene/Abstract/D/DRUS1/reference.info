NA	The Rice Receptor-like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization in Reproductive Development.	2017	Plant Cell	Institute of Molecular Cell Biology CITY: Shijiazhuang STATE: Hebei China [CN].	Cell-cell communication precisely controls the creation of new organs during reproductive growth. However, the sensor molecules that mediate developmental signals in monocot plants are poorly understood. Here, we report that DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 (DRUS1) and DRUS2, two closely related receptor-like kinases (RLKs), redundantly control reproductive growth and development in Oryza sativa (rice). A drus1-1 drus2 double knockout mutant, but not either single mutant, showed extreme dwarfism and barren inflorescences that harbored sterile spikelets. The gibberellin pathway was not impaired in this mutant. A phenotypic comparison of mutants expressing different amounts of DRUS1 and 2 revealed that reproductive growth requires a threshold level of DRUS1/2 proteins. DRUS1 and 2 maintain cell viability by repressing protease-mediated cell degradation and likely by affecting sugar utilization or conversion. In the later stages of anther development, survival of the endothecium requires DRUS1/2, which may stimulate expression of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene UGP2 and starch biosynthesis in pollen. Unlike their Arabidopsis thaliana ortholog FERONIA, DRUS1 and 2 mediate a fundamental signaling process that is essential for cell survival and represents a novel biological function for the CrRLK1L RLK subfamily.
NA	Two FERONIA-like receptor (FLR) genes are required to maintain architecture, fertility, and seed yield in rice	2016	Molecular Breeding	Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Developmental Regulation, Hunan University, Changsha, 410082, Hunan Province, People¡¯s Republic of China	The Arabidopsis gene FERONIA (FER) regulates cell elongation and fertility. Although the function of FER in promoting plant growth and regulating fructification in dicotyledon Arabidopsis has been investigated, how homologous FERONIA-like receptors (FLRs) function in the monocotyledon rice crop is little known. In this study, we generated flr1 and flr2 T-DNA insertion null mutants and investigated potential role of FLRs in rice yield. We observed that both FLR1 and FLR2 were involved in tillering of rice, but at different levels. Interestingly, FLR1 and FLR2 showed different functions related to fertility, and FLR1 might be specifically involved in rice male gametophyte development. With these similar but different functions, we suggest that FLR1 and FLR2 might function in complementary ways to regulate the yield of rice. The similar and different functions of FLR1 and FLR2 also suggest that there might be differentiation from FER to the duplication of FLRs, with FLR1 and FLR2 taking on partial functions from FER.
NA	Roles of FERONIA-like receptor genes in regulating grain size and quality in rice	2020	Science China Life Sciences	State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, and Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Developmental Regulation, College of Biology, Hunan University, Changsha, 410082, China.	Grain yield and quality are critical factors that determine the value of grain crops. In this study, we analyzed the functions of 12 FERONIA-like receptor (FLR) family members in rice and investigated their effects on grain size and quality. We found that FLR1, FLR2 and FLR8 negatively regulated grain size, and FLR15 positively regulated grain size. flr1 mutants had a higher cell number and an accelerated rate of grain filling compared to wild-type plants, which led to grains with greater widths. A mechanism underlying the regulation of grain size by FLR1 is that FLR1 is associated with OsRac1 Rho-like GTPase, a positive regulator of grain size. Regarding grain quality, the flr1 mutant had a higher percentage of chalkiness compared with wild-type plants, and seeds carrying mutations in flr3 and flr14 had endosperms with white floury cores. To elucidate the possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we found that FLR1 was constitutively expressed during endosperm development. RNA-seq analysis identified 2,367 genes that were differentially expressed in the flr1 mutant, including genes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism and carbon fixation. In this study, we identified the roles played by several FLR genes in regulating grain size and quality in rice and provided insights into the molecular mechanism governing the FLR1-mediated regulation of grain size.
