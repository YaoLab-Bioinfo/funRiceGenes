1-s2.0-S0031942206002950-main.pdf	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	2006	Phytochemistry	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan.	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of plant hormones involved in a wide range of plant growth and developmental processes. To investigate the mechanism of BR action in monocots, a brassinolide (BL) upregulated gene designated OsBLE3 was identified, cloned and characterized in rice. It was mainly expressed in roots and leaf sheaths with levels of expression directly dependent on the dose of BL. In situ hybridization detected OsBLE3 mRNA in the shoot apical meristem, organ primordia and vascular tissue. Furthermore, its expression was enhanced by co-treatment with BL and low concentrations of IAA. These results, and the existence of auxin response elements in the 5'-flanking region of the OsBLE3 gene, indicate that OsBLE3 expression is under control of both BR and auxin. The GUS reporter gene driven by a 2277 bp OsBLE3 putative promoter was mainly expressed in vascular tissues, branch root primordia and was responsive to exogenous BL treatment. OsBLE3 transcript levels were greatly reduced in brd1 plants, a BL deficient mutant, compared to the wild type control. In OsBRI1 antisense transgenic rice and OsBLE3, the BR-insensitive mutant expression of OsBLE3 in response to exogenous BL treatment was significantly lower compared to that in control plants transformed with a vacant vector. Reduced OsBLE3 expression and growth retardation was also observed in OsBLE3 antisense transgenic rice plants. Internode cell length of the OsBLE3 antisense transgenic lines was about 70% of that in the vacant vector transformed control lines. These results suggest that OsBLE3 is involved in cell elongation in rice through dual regulation by BL and IAA.
1-s2.0-S0168945212002221-main.pdf	Kinase activity of OsBRI1 is essential for brassinosteroids to regulate rice growth and development	2013	Plant Sci	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid hormones that participate in multiple biological processes. In this paper, we characterized a classic rice mutant Fn189 (dwarf54, d54) showing semi-dwarf stature and erect leaves. The coleoptile elongation and root growth was less affected in Fn189 than wild-type plant by the exogenous application of eBL, the most active form of BRs. Lamina joint inclination assay and morphological analysis in darkness further showed that Fn189 mutant plant was insensitive to exogenous eBL. Through map-based cloning, Fn189 was found to be a novel allelic mutant of the DWARF 61 (D61) gene, which encodes the putative BRs receptor OsBRI1. A single base mutation caused the I834F substitution in the OsBRI1 kinase domain. Consequently, kinase activity of OsBRI1 was found to decrease dramatically. Taken together, the kinase activity of OsBRI1 is essential for brassinosteroids to regulate normal plant growth and development in rice.
1939-8433-5-4.pdf	Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice	2012	Rice (N Y)	Faculty of Biotechnology, Fukui Prefectural University, 4-1-1 Kenjojima, Matsuoka, Eiheiji-Town, Fukui 910-1195, Japan.	Seed size is an important trait in determinant of rice seed quality and yield. In this study, we report a novel semi-dominant mutant Small and round seed 5 (Srs5) that encodes alpha-tubulin protein. Lemma cell length was reduced in Srs5 compared with that of the wild-type. Mutants defective in the G-protein alpha subunit (d1-1) and brassinosteroid receptor, BRI1 (d61-2) also exhibited short seed phenotypes, the former due to impaired cell numbers and the latter due to impaired cell length. Seeds of the double mutant of Srs5 and d61-2 were smaller than those of Srs5 or d61-2. Furthermore, SRS5 and BRI1 genes were highly expressed in Srs5 and d61-2 mutants. These data indicate that SRS5 independently regulates cell elongation of the brassinosteroid signal transduction pathway.
j.1365-313X.2011.04873.x.pdf	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	2012	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China.	Methylation of histone lysine residues plays an essential role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Enzymes involved in establishment of the repressive H3K9 and H3K27 methylation marks have been previously characterized, but the deposition and function of H3K4 and H3K36 methylation remain uncharacterized in rice. Here, we report that rice SDG725 encodes a H3K36 methyltransferase, and its down-regulation causes wide-ranging defects, including dwarfism, shortened internodes, erect leaves and small seeds. These defects resemble the phenotypes previously described for some brassinosteroid-knockdown mutants. Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that levels of H3K36me2/3 are reduced in chromatin at some regions of these brassinosteroid-related genes in SDG725 knockdown plants, and that SDG725 protein is able to directly bind to these target genes. Taken together, our data indicate that SDG725-mediated H3K36 methylation modulates brassinosteroid-related gene expression, playing an important role in rice plant growth and development.
Plant Cell-2000-Yamamuro-1591-605.pdf	Loss of function of a rice brassinosteroid insensitive1 homolog prevents internode elongation and bending of the lamina joint	2000	Plant Cell	Nagoya University, BioScience Center, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant growth-promoting natural products required for plant growth and development. Physiological studies have demonstrated that exogenous BR, alone or in combination with auxin, enhance bending of the lamina joint of rice. However, little is known about the function of endogenous BR in rice or other grass species. We report here the phenotypical and molecular characterization of a rice dwarf mutant, d61, that is less sensitive to BR compared to the wild type. We cloned a rice gene, OsBRI1, with extensive sequence similarity to that of the Arabidopsis BRI gene, which encodes a putative BR receptor kinase. Linkage analysis showed that the OsBRI1 gene is closely linked to the d61 locus. Single nucleotide substitutions found at different sites of the d61 alleles would give rise to amino acid changes in the corresponding polypeptides. Furthermore, introduction of the entire OsBRI1 coding region, including the 5' and 3' flanking sequences, into d61 plants complemented the mutation to display the wild-type phenotype. Transgenic plants carrying the antisense strand of the OsBRI1 transcript showed similar or even more severe phenotypes than those of the d61 mutants. Our results show that OsBRI1 functions in various growth and developmental processes in rice, including (1) internode elongation, by inducing the formation of the intercalary meristem and the longitudinal elongation of internode cells; (2) bending of the lamina joint; and (3) skotomorphogenesis.
Plant Cell-2010-Je-1777-91.pdf	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice	2010	Plant Cell	Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Program), Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center, Environmental Biotechnology National Core Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Korea.	Temporal and spatial variation in the levels of and sensitivity to hormones are essential for the development of higher organisms. Traditionally, end-product feedback regulation has been considered as the key mechanism for the achievement of cellular homeostasis. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that are perceived by the cell surface receptor kinase Brassinosteroid Insensitive1. Binding of these hormones to the receptor activates BR signaling and eventually suppresses BR synthesis. This report shows that RAVL1 regulates the expression of the BR receptor. Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback. Activation by RAVL1 was coordinated via E-box cis-elements in the promoters of the receptor and biosynthetic genes. Also, RAVL1 is necessary for the response of these genes to changes in cellular BR homeostasis. Genetic evidence is presented to strengthen the observation that the primary action of RAVL1 mediates the expression of genes involved in BR signaling and biosynthesis. This study thus describes a regulatory circuit modulating the homeostasis of BR in which RAVL1 ensures the basal activity of both the signaling and the biosynthetic pathways.
Plant Physiol.-2009-Tanaka-669-80.pdf	BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1, encoding a helix-loop-helix protein, is a novel gene involved in brassinosteroid signaling and controls bending of the lamina joint in rice	2009	Plant Physiol	Disease Resistance Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan.	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are involved in many developmental processes and regulate many subsets of downstream genes throughout the plant kingdom. However, little is known about the BR signal transduction and response network in monocots. To identify novel BR-related genes in rice (Oryza sativa), we monitored the transcriptomic response of the brassinosteroid deficient1 (brd1) mutant, with a defective BR biosynthetic gene, to brassinolide treatment. Here, we describe a novel BR-induced rice gene BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1), encoding a helix-loop-helix protein. Rice plants overexpressing BU1 (BU1:OX) showed enhanced bending of the lamina joint, increased grain size, and resistance to brassinazole, an inhibitor of BR biosynthesis. In contrast to BU1:OX, RNAi plants designed to repress both BU1 and its homologs displayed erect leaves. In addition, compared to the wild type, the induction of BU1 by exogenous brassinolide did not require de novo protein synthesis and it was weaker in a BR receptor mutant OsbriI (Oryza sativa brassinosteroid insensitive1, d61) and a rice G protein alpha subunit (RGA1) mutant d1. These results indicate that BU1 protein is a positive regulator of BR response: it controls bending of the lamina joint in rice and it is a novel primary response gene that participates in two BR signaling pathways through OsBRI1 and RGA1. Furthermore, expression analyses showed that BU1 is expressed in several organs including lamina joint, phloem, and epithelial cells in embryos. These results indicate that BU1 may participate in some other unknown processes modulated by BR in rice.
pp1400580.pdf	The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice	2006	Plant Physiol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	Since first identifying two alleles of a rice (Oryza sativa) brassinosteroid (BR)-insensitive mutant, d61, that were also defective in an orthologous gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), we have isolated eight additional alleles, including null mutations, of the rice BRI1 gene OsBRI1. The most severe mutant, d61-4, exhibited severe dwarfism and twisted leaves, although pattern formation and differentiation were normal. This severe shoot phenotype was caused mainly by a defect in cell elongation and the disturbance of cell division after the determination of cell fate. In contrast to its severe shoot phenotype, the d61-4 mutant had a mild root phenotype. Concomitantly, the accumulation of castasterone, the active BR in rice, was up to 30-fold greater in the shoots, while only 1.5-fold greater in the roots. The homologous genes for OsBRI1, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, were highly expressed in roots but weakly expressed in shoots, and their expression was higher in d61-4 than in the wild type. Based on these observations, we conclude that OsBRI1 is not essential for pattern formation or organ initiation, but is involved in organ development through controlling cell division and elongation. In addition, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3 are at least partly involved in BR perception in the roots.
pp1410924.pdf	Morphological alteration caused by brassinosteroid insensitivity increases the biomass and grain production of rice	2006	Plant Physiol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan.	The rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant d61 phenotype is caused by loss of function of a rice BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 ortholog, OsBRI1. We have identified nine d61 alleles, the weakest of which, d61-7, confers agronomically important traits such as semidwarf stature and erect leaves. Because erect-leaf habit is considered to increase light capture for photosynthesis, we compared the biomass and grain production of wild-type and d61-7 rice. The biomass of wild type was 38% higher than that of d61-7 at harvest under conventional planting density because of the dwarfism of d61-7. However, the biomass of d61-7 was 35% higher than that of wild type at high planting density. The grain yield of wild type reached a maximum at middensity, but the yield of d61-7 continued to increase with planting density. These results indicate that d61-7 produces biomass more effectively than wild type, and consequently more effectively assimilates the biomass in reproductive organ development at high planting density. However, the small grain size of d61-7 counters any increase in grain yield, leading to the same grain yield as that of wild type even at high density. We therefore produced transgenic rice with partial suppression of endogenous OsBRI1 expression to obtain the erect-leaf phenotype without grain changes. The estimated grain yield of these transformants was about 30% higher than that of wild type at high density. These results demonstrate the feasibility of generating erect-leaf plants by modifying the expression of the brassinosteroid receptor gene in transgenic rice plants.
Zhangcui-MP.pdf	RPL1, a gene involved in epigenetic processes regulates phenotypic plasticity in rice	2012	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Organisms can adjust their phenotype in response to changing environmental conditions. This phenomenon is termed phenotypic plasticity. Despite its ubiquitous occurrence, there has been very little study on the molecular mechanism of phenotypic plasticity. In this study, we isolated a rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant, rice plasticity 1 (rpl1), that displayed increased environment-dependent phenotypic variations. RPL1 was expressed in all tissues examined. The protein was localized in the nucleus and its distribution in the nucleus overlapped with heterochromatin. The rpl1 mutation led to an increase in DNA methylation on repetitive sequences and a decrease in overall histone acetylation. In addition, the mutation affected responses of the rice plant to phytohormones such as brassinosteroid, gibberellin, and cytokinin. Analysis of the putative rice brassinosteroid receptor OsBRI1, a key hormone signaling gene, indicated that RPL1 may be involved in the regulation of epigenomic modification of the gene. These data suggest that RPL1 regulated phenotypic plasticity likely through its involvement in epigenetic processes affecting responses of the plant to phytohormones.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
NA	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	2021	J Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Guangxi Key Laboratory of Rice Genetics and Breeding, Nanning, 530007 China.	Although morphology and grain size are important to rice growth and yield, the identity of abundant natural allelic variations that determine agronomically important differences in crops is unknown. Here, we characterized the function of mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 from Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt encoded by OrMKK3. Different alternative splicing variants occurred in OrMKK3. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OrMKK3 fusion proteins localized to the cell membrane and nuclei of rice protoplasts. Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OrMKK3 is well conserved in plants while showing large amounts of variation between indica, japonica, and wild rice. In addition, OrMKK3 slightly influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression levels of BR-related genes. Our findings thus identify a new gene, OrMKK3, influencing morphology and grain size and that represents a possible link between mitogen-activated protein kinase and BR response pathways in grain growth.
NA	Regulation of Brassinosteroid Signaling and Salt Resistance by SERK2 and Potential Utilization for Crop Improvement in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	The complex roles of the steroid hormone brassinosteroids (BRs) in many different yield- and stress-related traits make it difficult to utilize the hormones for crop improvement. Here, we show that SERK2 as a BR signaling component is a potentially useful candidate for BR manipulation in rice. We generated multiple mutant alleles of SERK2 by CRISPR/Cas9 editing and show that knockout of SERK2 results in a compact structure accompanied with increased grain size. SERK2 is localized on plasma membrane and can interact with OsBRI1, the BR receptor, suggesting its conserved role as co-receptor in BR signaling. Consistently, the mutant has impaired BR sensitivity compared to wild type. Notably, the mutant is highly sensitive to salt stress as evaluated by plant survival rate as well as transcriptome analysis, whereas has slightly increased sensitivity to ABA, the stress hormone. By contrast, overexpression of SERK2 significantly enhances grain size and salt stress resistance, importantly, without affecting plant architecture. Furthermore, while salt suppresses SERK2 transcription, the protein is greatly induced by salt stress. Taken together, we propose that the adverse condition induces SERK2 accumulation to enhance early BR signaling on plasma membrane in favor of the anti-stress response. Our results illustrate the great potentials of specific BR components such as SERK2 for crop improvement by utilizing flexible strategies.
