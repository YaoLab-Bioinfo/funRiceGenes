NA	Plastidial Disproportionating Enzyme Participates in Starch Synthesis in Rice Endosperm by Transferring Maltooligosyl Groups from Amylose and Amylopectin to Amylopectin.	2015	Plant Physiol	Institute of Botany, CAS CITY: Beijing China [CN].	Plastidial disproportionating enzyme (DPE1), an α-1,4-D-glucanotransferase, has been thought to be involved in storage starch synthesis in cereal crops. However, the precise function of DPE1 remains to be established. We present here the functional identification of DPE1 in storage starch synthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by endosperm-specific gene overexpression and suppression. DPE1 overexpression decreased amylose content and resulted in small and tightly packed starch granules, whereas DPE1 suppression increased amylose content and formed heterogeneous-sized, spherical, and loosely packed starch granules. Chains with degree of polymerization (DP) of 6-10 and 23-38 were increased, while chains with DP of 11-22 were decreased in amylopectin from DPE1-overexpressing seeds. In contrast, chains with DP of 6-8 and 16-36 were decreased while chains with DP of 9-15 were increased in amylopectin from DPE1-suppressed seeds. Changes in DPE1 gene expression also resulted in modifications in the thermal and pasting features of endosperm starch granules. In vitro analyses revealed that recombinant DPE1 can break down amylose into maltooligosaccharides (MOS) in the presence of glucose, while it can transfer maltooligosyl groups from MOS to amylopectin or transfer maltooligosyl groups inter- and intra- amylopectin molecules in the absence of glucose. Moreover, a metabolic flow of maltooligosyl groups from amylose to amylopectin was clearly identifiable when comparing DPE1-overexpressing lines with DPE1-suppressed lines. These findings demonstrate that DPE1 participates substantially in starch synthesis in rice endosperm by transferring maltooligosyl groups from amylose and amylopectin to amylopectin.
NA	Rice endosperm starch phosphorylase (Pho1) assembles with disproportionating enzyme (Dpe1) to form a protein complex that enhances synthesis of malto-oligosaccharides.	2016	J Biol Chem	Washington State University, United States;	Starch synthesis in cereal grain endosperm is dependent on the concerted actions of many enzymes. The starch plastidial phosphorylase (Pho1) plays an important role in the initiation of starch synthesis and in the maturation of starch granule in developing rice seeds. Prior evidence has suggested that the rice enzyme, OsPho1, may have a physical/functional interaction with other starch biosynthetic enzymes. Pull-down experiments showed that OsPho1 as well as OsPho1 devoid of its L80 region, a peptide unique to higher plant phosphorylases, captures disproportionating enzyme (OsDpe1). Interaction of the latter enzyme form with OsDpe1 indicates that the putative regulatory L80 is not responsible for multi-enzyme assembly. This heterotypic enzyme complex, determined at a molar ratio of 1:1, was validated by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies of native seed proteins and by co-elution chromatographic and co-migration electrophoretic patterns of these enzymes in rice seed extracts. The OsPho1-OsDpe1 complex utilized a broader range of substrates for enhanced synthesis of larger malto-oligosaccharides than each individual enzyme and significantly elevated the substrate affinities of OsPho1 at 30oC. Moreover, the assembly with OsDpe1 enables OsPho1 to utilize products of transglycosylation reactions involving G1 and G3, sugars that it cannot catalyze directly.
NA	Pho1 cooperates with DPE1 to control short maltooligosaccharide mobilization during starch synthesis initiation in rice endosperm.	2023	Theor Appl Genet	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	Plastidial α-glucan phosphorylase is a key factor that cooperates with plastidial disproportionating enzyme to control short maltooligosaccharide mobilization during the initiation process of starch molecule synthesis in developing rice endosperm. Storage starch synthesis is essential for grain filling. However, little is known about how cereal endosperm controls starch synthesis initiation. One of core events for starch synthesis initiation is short maltooligosaccharide (MOS) mobilization consisting of long MOS primer production and excess MOS breakdown. By mutant analyses and biochemical investigations, we present here functional identifications of plastidial α-glucan phosphorylase (Pho1) and disproportionating enzyme (DPE1) during starch synthesis initiation in rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm. Pho1 deficiency impaired MOS mobilization, triggering short MOS accumulation and starch synthesis reduction during early seed development. The mutant seeds differed significantly in MOS level and starch content at 15 days after flowering and exhibited diverse endosperm phenotypes during mid-late seed development: ranging from pseudonormal to shrunken (Shr), severely or excessively Shr. The level of DPE1 was almost normal in the PN seeds but significantly reduced in the Shr seeds. Overexpression of DPE1 in pho1 resulted in plump seeds only. DPE1 deficiency had no obvious effects on MOS mobilization. Knockout of DPE1 in pho1 completely blocked MOS mobilization, resulting in severely and excessively Shr seeds only. These findings show that Pho1 cooperates with DPE1 to control short MOS mobilization during starch synthesis initiation in rice endosperm.
