NA	Dwarf and High Tillering1 represses rice tillering through mediating the splicing of D14 pre-mRNA.	2022	Plant Cell	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Strigolactones (SLs) constitute a class of plant hormones that regulate many aspects of plant development, including repressing tillering in rice (Oryza sativa). However, how SL pathways are regulated is still poorly understood. Here, we describe a rice mutant dwarf and high tillering1 (dht1), which exhibits pleiotropic phenotypes (such as dwarfism and increased tiller numbers) similar to those of mutants defective in SL signaling. We show that DHT1 encodes a monocotyledon-specific hnRNP-like protein that acts as a previously unrecognized intron splicing factor for many precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs), including for the SL receptor gene D14. We find that the dht1 (DHT1I232F) mutant protein is impaired in its stability and RNA binding activity, causing defective splicing of D14 pre-mRNA and reduced D14 expression, and consequently leading to the SL signaling-defective phenotypes. Overall, our findings deepen our understanding of the functional diversification of hnRNP-like proteins and establish a connection between posttranscriptional splicing and SL signaling in the regulation of plant development.
