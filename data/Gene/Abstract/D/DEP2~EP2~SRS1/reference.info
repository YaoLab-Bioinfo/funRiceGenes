85_327.pdf	The SMALL AND ROUND SEED1 (SRS1/DEP2) gene is involved in the regulation of seed size in rice	2010	Genes Genet Syst	Department of Bioscience, Fukui Prefectural University	The causal gene of a novel small and round seed mutant 1 (srs1) was identified in rice by map-based cloning and named SMALL AND ROUND SEED 1 (SRS1). The SRS1 gene is identical to the previously identified DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 2 (DEP2). The SRS1/DEP2 gene encodes a novel protein of 1365 amino acids residues without known functional domains. In the longitudinal direction of the lemma, both cell length and cell number are reduced in srs1-1 compared to the wild type, whereas in the lateral cross section of the lemma, cell length in srs1-1 is greater than that in the wild type, but the cell number in srs1-1 is the same as that in wild type. These results suggest that the small and round seed phenotype of srs1-1 is due to the reduction in both cell length and cell number in the longitudinal direction, and the elongation of the cells in the lateral direction of the lemma. The SRS1 mRNA and proteins are abundant in wild type rice specifically in young organs, namely young leaves, internodes and panicles. Interestingly, the tissues expressing SRS1 are closely related to the tissues that exhibit abnormalities in the srs1 mutants.
cr201069a.pdf	Rice DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 2 is essential for determining panicle outgrowth and elongation	2010	Cell Res	National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The architecture of the panicle, including grain size and panicle morphology, directly determines grain yield. Panicle erectness, which is selected for achieving ideal plant architecture in the northern part of China, has drawn increasing attention of rice breeders. Here, dense and erect panicle 2 (dep2) mutant, which shows a dense and erect panicle phenotype, was identified. DEP2 encodes a plant-specific protein without any known functional domain. Expression profiling of DEP2 revealed that it is highly expressed in young tissues, with most abundance in young panicles. Morphological and expression analysis indicated that mutation in DEP2 mainly affects the rapid elongation of rachis and primary and secondary branches, but does not impair the initiation or formation of panicle primordia. Further analysis suggests that decrease of panicle length in dep2 is caused by a defect in cell proliferation during the exponential elongation of panicle. Despite a more compact plant type in the dep2 mutant, no significant alteration in grain production was found between wild type and dep2 mutant. Therefore, the study of DEP2 not only strengthens our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of panicle architecture but also has important implications for rice breeding.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) inflorescence (panicle) architecture is an important agronomic trait for rice breeding. A number of high-yielding japonica rice strains, characterized by an erect panicle (EP) of their architecture, have been released as commercial varieties in China. But no EP-type indica varieties are released so far. Here, we identified two allelic erect-panicle mutants in indica rice, erect panicle2-1 (ep2-1) and erect panicle2-2 (ep2-2), exhibiting the characteristic erect panicle phenotype. Both mutants were derived from spontaneous mutation. We cloned the EP2 gene by way of a map-based cloning strategy, and a transgenic complementation test rescued the phenotype of ep2-1. Anatomical investigations revealed that the ep2 mutants have more vascular bundles and a thicker stem than that of wild-type plants, explaining the panicle erectness phenotype in ep2 mutants. It was shown that EP2 was specifically expressed in the vascular bundles of internodes by GUS staining and RT-PCR. EP2 encodes a novel plant-specific protein, which localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum with unknown biochemical function. In addition, EP2 also regulates other panicle characteristics, such as panicle length and grain size, but grain number per panicle shows little change, indicating that the mutation of the ep2 gene could be applied in EP-type indica rice breeding.
NA	OsRELA Regulates Leaf Inclination by Repressing the Transcriptional Activity of OsLIC in Rice	2021	Front Plant Sci	Joint CAAS/IRRI Laboratory for Photosynthetic Enhancement, Biotechnology Research Institute/National Key Facility for Genetic Resources and Gene Improvement, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Leaf angle is one of the most important agronomic traits in rice, and changes in leaf angle can alter plant architecture to affect photosynthetic efficiency and thus determine grain yield. Therefore, it is important to identify key genes controlling leaf angle and elucidate the molecular mechanisms to improve rice yield. We obtained a mutant rela (regulator of leaf angle) with reduced leaf angle in rice by EMS mutagenesis, and map-based cloning revealed that OsRELA encodes a protein of unknown function. Coincidentally, DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 2 (DEP2) was reported in a previous study with the same gene locus. RNA-seq analysis revealed that OsRELA is involved in regulating the expression of ILI and Expansin family genes. Biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that OsRELA is able to interact with OsLIC, a negative regulator of BR signaling, through its conserved C-terminal domain, which is essential for OsRELA function in rice. The binding of OsRELA can activate the expression of downstream genes repressed by OsLIC, such as OsILI1, a positive regulator of leaf inclination in rice. Therefore, our results suggest that OsRELA can act as a transcriptional regulator and is involved in the regulation of leaf inclination by regulating the transcriptional activity of OsLIC.
