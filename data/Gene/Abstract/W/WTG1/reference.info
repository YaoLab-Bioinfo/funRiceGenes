NA	WIDE AND THICK GRAIN 1, which encodes an otubain-like protease with deubiquitination activity, influences grain size and shape in rice.	2017	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering, CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Plant Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Grain size and shape are two crucial traits that influence grain yield and grain appearance in rice. Although several factors that affect grain size have been described in rice, the molecular mechanisms underlying grain size and shape determination are still elusive. In this study, we report that the WIDE AND THICK GRAIN 1 (WTG1) functions as an important factor that determines grain size and shape in rice. The wtg1-1 mutant exhibits wide, thick, short and heavy grains and also shows the increased grain number per panicle. WTG1 determines grain size and shape mainly by influencing cell expansion. WTG1 encodes an otubain-like protease, which shares similarity with human OTUB1. Biochemical analyses indicate that WTG1 is a functional deubiquitinating enzyme, and the mutant protein (wtg1-1) loses the activity of deubiquitinating enzyme. WTG1 is expressed in developing grains and panicles, and the GFP-WTG1 fusion protein is present in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Overexpression of WTG1 results in narrow, thin and long grains due to narrow and long cells, further supporting the role of WTG1 in determining grain size and shape. Thus, our findings identify the otubain-like protease WTG1 as an important factor that determines grain size and shape, suggesting WTG1 has the potential to improve grain size and shape in rice.

NA	Non-canonical regulation of SPL transcription factors by a human OTUB1-like deubiquitinase defines a new plant type rice associated with higher grain yield.	2017	Cell Res	The State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Centre for Plant Gene Research, Beijing 100101, China.	Achieving increased grain productivity has long been the overriding focus of cereal breeding programs. The ideotype approach has been used to improve rice yield potential at the International Rice Research Institute and in China. However, the genetic basis of yield-related traits in rice remains unclear. Here, we show that a major quantitative trait locus, qNPT1, acts through the determination of a 'new plant type' (NPT) architecture characterized by fewer tillers, sturdier culms and larger panicles, and it encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme with homology to human OTUB1. Downregulation of OsOTUB1 enhances meristematic activity, resulting in reduced tiller number, increased grain number, enhanced grain weight and a consequent increase in grain yield in rice. Unlike human OTUB1, OsOTUB1 can cleave both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin. OsOTUB1 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein OsUBC13 and the squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor OsSPL14. OsOTUB1 and OsSPL14 share common target genes, and their physical interaction limits K63-linked ubiquitination (K63Ub) of OsSPL14, which in turn promotes K48Ub-dependent proteasomal degradation of OsSPL14. Conversely, loss-of-function of OsOTUB1 is correlated with the accumulation of high levels of OsSPL14, resulting in the NPT architecture. We also demonstrated that pyramiding of high-yielding npt1 and dep1-1 alleles provides a new strategy for increasing rice yield potential above what is currently achievable.Cell Research advance online publication 4 August 2017; doi:10.1038/cr.2017.98.
NA	GWC1 is essential for high grain quality in rice 	2020	Plant Sci .	Rice Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.	Appearance quality is an important determinant of rice quality. Many genes that affect grain appearance quality have been identified, but the regulatory mechanisms that contribute to this trait remain unclear. Here, two grains with chalkiness (gwc1) mutants, gwc1-1 and gwc1-2, were identified from an EMS-mutagenized population of indica rice cultivar Shuhui498 (R498). The gwc1 mutants had poor grain appearance quality consistent with the measured values for the percentage of grains with chalkiness, square of chalky endosperm, the total starch, amylose and sucrose contents. Milling quality and grain size were also affected in the gwc1 mutants. The gwc1-1 and gwc1-2 were found to be loss-of-function allelic mutants. GWC1 was mapped to the long arm of rice chromosome 8 using the MutMap strategy and incorrectly annotated in the reference genome for Nipponbare (MSU). The GWC1 gene corresponds to the WTG1/OsOTUB1 gene, which encodes an otubain-like protease with deubiquitinating activity that is homologous to human OTUB1. GWC1 transcripts accumulated to high levels in early endosperm after fertilization and developing inflorescences, and GWC1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal was detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm. GWC1 is likely to regulate grain appearance quality through genes involved in sucrose metabolism and starch biosynthesis. Overall, the present findings reveal that GWC1 is important for grain quality and yield due to its effects on grain chalkiness and size.
