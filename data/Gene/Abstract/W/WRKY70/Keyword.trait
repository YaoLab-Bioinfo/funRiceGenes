WRKY70|OsWRKY70	growth	Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.	In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis
WRKY70|OsWRKY70	gibberellin	Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.	In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis
