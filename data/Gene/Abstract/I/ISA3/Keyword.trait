ISA3|OsISA3	chloroplast	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic
ISA3|OsISA3	endosperm	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	We investigated whether ISA3 plays a role in amyloplast development and starch metabolism in the developing endosperm
ISA3|OsISA3	endosperm	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	ISA3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein expressed under the control of the rice ISA3 promoter was targeted to the amyloplast stroma in the endosperm
ISA3|OsISA3	endosperm	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	Both overexpression and loss of function of ISA3 in the endosperm generated pleomorphic amyloplasts and starch granules
ISA3|OsISA3	starch	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	A transposon-inserted rice mutant of isoamylase3 (isa3) contained an increased amount of starch in the leaf blade at the end of the night, indicating that ISA3 plays a role in the degradation of transitory starch during the night
ISA3|OsISA3	starch	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	We investigated whether ISA3 plays a role in amyloplast development and starch metabolism in the developing endosperm
ISA3|OsISA3	starch	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	Overexpression of ISA3 in the sugary1 mutant, which is deficient in ISA1 activity, did not convert water-soluble phytoglycogen to starch granules, indicating that ISA1 and ISA3 are not functionally redundant
ISA3|OsISA3	starch	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	Both overexpression and loss of function of ISA3 in the endosperm generated pleomorphic amyloplasts and starch granules
ISA3|OsISA3	starch	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	These results suggest that ISA3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects morphological characteristics of plastids in rice
ISA3|OsISA3	leaf	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	A transposon-inserted rice mutant of isoamylase3 (isa3) contained an increased amount of starch in the leaf blade at the end of the night, indicating that ISA3 plays a role in the degradation of transitory starch during the night
ISA3|OsISA3	leaf	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic
ISA3|OsISA3	seedling	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic
