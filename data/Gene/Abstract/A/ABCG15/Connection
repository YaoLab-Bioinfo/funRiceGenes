OsABCG15	WDA1	The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice	Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules

OsABCG15	OsABCG26	Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.	Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.
OsABCG15	OsABCG26	Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.	Here, we report the significant role of OsABCG26 in regulating the development of anther cuticle and pollen exine together with OsABCG15 in rice
OsABCG15	OsABCG26	Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.	osabcg26 osabcg15 double mutant displays an almost complete absence of anther cuticle and pollen exine, similar to that of osabcg15 single mutant
OsABCG15	OsABCG26	Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.	Taken together, we propose that OsABCG26 and OsABCG15 collaboratively regulate rice male reproduction: OsABCG26 is mainly responsible for the transport of lipidic molecules from tapetal cells to anther wall layers, while OsABCG15 mainly is responsible for the export of lipidic molecules from the tapetal cells to anther locules for pollen exine development
OsABCG15	OsABCG26	An ABC transporter, OsABCG26, is required for anther cuticle and pollen exine formation and pollen-pistil interactions in rice	Expression of some key genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport, such as UDT1, WDA1, CYP704B2, OsABCG15, OsC4 and OsC6, was significantly altered in osabcg26 anther, possibly due to a disturbance in the homeostasis of anther lipid metabolism and transport
CYP703A3	OsABCG15	Identification of cyp703a3-3 and analysis of regulatory role of CYP703A3 in rice anther cuticle and pollen exine development.	 Results of qPCR suggested CYP703A3 mainly expressed in anthers with greatest abundance at microspore stage, and genes involved in sporopollenin precursors formation and transportation, such as GAMYB, TDR, CYP704B2, DPW2, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, were significantly reduced in cyp703a3-3
