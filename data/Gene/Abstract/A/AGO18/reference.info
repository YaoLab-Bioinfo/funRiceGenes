NA	Viral-inducible Argonaute18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice by sequestering a host microRNA.	2015	Elife	State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, College of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.	Viral pathogens are a major threat to rice production worldwide. Although RNA interference (RNAi) is known to mediate antiviral immunity in plant and animal models, the mechanism of antiviral RNAi in rice and other economically important crops is poorly understood. Here, we report that rice resistance to evolutionarily diverse viruses requires Argonaute18 (AGO18). Genetic studies reveal that the antiviral function of AGO18 depends on its activity to sequester microRNA168 (miR168) to alleviate repression of rice AGO1 essential for antiviral RNAi. Expression of miR168-resistant AGO1a in ago18 background rescues or increases rice antiviral activity. Notably, stable transgenic expression of AGO18 confers broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice. Our findings uncover a novel cooperative antiviral activity of two distinct AGO proteins and suggest a new strategy for the control of viral diseases in rice.
NA	Genome-wide identification, organization and phylogenetic analysis of Dicer-like, Argonaute and RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase gene families and their expression analysis during reproductive development and stress in rice.	2008	BMC Genomics	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, New Delhi-110021, India. kapoors@genomeindia.org	Important developmental processes in both plants and animals are partly regulated by genes whose expression is modulated at the post-transcriptional level by processes such as RNA interference (RNAi). Dicers, Argonautes and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDR) form the core components that facilitate gene silencing and have been implicated in the initiation and maintenance of the trigger RNA molecules, central to process of RNAi. Investigations in eukaryotes have revealed that these proteins are encoded by variable number of genes with plants showing relatively higher number in each gene family. To date, no systematic expression profiling of these genes in any of the organisms has been reported.In this study, we provide a complete analysis of rice Dicer-like, Argonaute and RDR gene families including gene structure, genomic localization and phylogenetic relatedness among gene family members. We also present microarray-based expression profiling of these genes during 14 stages of reproductive and 5 stages of vegetative development and in response to cold, salt and dehydration stress. We have identified 8 Dicer-like (OsDCLs), 19 Argonaute (OsAGOs) and 5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (OsRDRs) genes in rice. Based on phylogeny, each of these genes families have been categorized into four subgroups. Although most of the genes express both in vegetative and reproductive organs, 2 OsDCLs, 14 OsAGOs and 3 OsRDRs were found to express specifically/preferentially during stages of reproductive development. Of these, 2 OsAGOs exhibited preferential up-regulation in seeds. One of the Argonautes (OsAGO2) also showed specific up-regulation in response to cold, salt and dehydration stress.This investigation has identified 23 rice genes belonging to DCL, Argonaute and RDR gene families that could potentially be involved in reproductive development-specific gene regulatory mechanisms. These data provide an insight into probable domains of activity of these genes and a basis for further, more detailed investigations aimed at understanding the contribution of individual components of RNA silencing machinery during reproductive phase of plant development.
NA	ROS accumulation and antiviral defence control by microRNA528 in rice.	2017	Nat Plants	The State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, College of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of plant-pathogen interactions. Modulating miRNA function has emerged as a new strategy to produce virus resistance traits(1-5). However, the miRNAs involved in antiviral defence and the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. We previously demonstrated that sequestration by Argonaute (AGO) proteins plays an important role in regulating miRNA function in antiviral defence pathways(6). Here we reveal that cleavage-defective AGO18 complexes sequester microRNA528 (miR528) upon viral infection. We show that miR528 negatively regulates viral resistance in rice by cleaving L-ascorbate oxidase (AO) messenger RNA, thereby reducing AO-mediated accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Upon viral infection, miR528 becomes preferentially associated with AGO18, leading to elevated AO activity, higher basal reactive oxygen species accumulation and enhanced antiviral defence. Our findings reveal a mechanism in which antiviral defence is boosted through suppression of an miRNA that negatively regulates viral resistance. This mechanism could be manipulated to engineer virus-resistant crop plants.
NA	Loss of function of Oryza sativa Argonaute 18 induces male sterility and reduction in phased small RNAs.	2020	Plant Reprod	National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, GKVK Campus, Bangalore, 560065, India.	In this manuscript, we show that Oryza sativa indica Argonaute protein AGO18 is required for male gametophyte development likely to through a small RNA-mediated mechanism. Monocots have evolved unique gene silencing pathways due to the presence of unique members of Dicer-like and Argonaute (AGO) family members. Among the monocot AGO homologs, AGO18 occupies a unique position. Previous reports have implicated this protein in viral resistance as well as in gametogenesis, likely through its competition with AGO1 clade members for micro(mi)RNAs and other small (s)RNAs. Although expression of rice AGO18 in specific stages of male gametogenesis has been documented, its major functions in plant development remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Oryza sativa indica AGO18 is involved in male gametophyte development. Knockdown (KD) of AGO18 in transgenic rice lines resulted in stunted plants that are male sterile, whereas their carpels were functional. Transcriptome analysis revealed downregulation of several pollen development-associated genes in KD lines. sRNA sequencing in vegetative and reproductive tissues of KD lines indicated reduction of miRNAs and phased secondary sRNAs implicated in male gametophyte development. Our results indicate a distinct role for rice AGO18 in male fertility.
