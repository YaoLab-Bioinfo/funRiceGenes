An-1	LABA1|OsLOGL6|An-2	An-2 Encodes a Cytokinin Synthesis Enzyme That Regulates Awn Length and Grain Production in Rice.	Expressional analysis demonstrates that An-1 regulates the formation of awn primordial, and An-2 promotes awn elongation
An-1	LABA1|OsLOGL6|An-2	Natural alleles of GLA for grain length and awn development were differently domesticated in rice subspecies japonica and indica.	 Analyses of minimum spanning trees and introgression regions demonstrated that An-1, an important gene for awn formation, was preferentially domesticated, and its mutation to an-1 was followed by GLA and An-2
