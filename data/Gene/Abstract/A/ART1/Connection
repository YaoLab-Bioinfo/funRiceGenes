ART1	OsFRDL4	An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice	Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
ART1	STAR1	A zinc finger transcription factor ART1 regulates multiple genes implicated in aluminum tolerance in rice	A yeast one-hybrid assay showed that ART1 has a transcriptional activation potential and interacts with the promoter region of STAR1, an important factor in rice Al tolerance
ART1	STAR1	A zinc finger transcription factor ART1 regulates multiple genes implicated in aluminum tolerance in rice	Microarray analysis revealed 31 downstream transcripts regulated by ART1, including STAR1 and 2 and a couple of homologs of Al tolerance genes in other plants
ART1	Nrat1	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1)
ART1	OsCDT3	A plasma membrane-localized small peptide is involved in rice aluminum tolerance	A transcription factor for Al tolerance, ART1, regulates the expression of at least 30 genes in rice. Here we functionally characterized one of the downstream genes, OsCDT3, which encodes a predicted peptide of only 53 amino acid residues rich in cysteine.
ART1	OsFRDL2	Functional analysis of a MATE gene OsFRDL2 revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.	Furthermore, the expression of OsFRDL2 was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type Zn-finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
ART1	OsEXPA10	An Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10 is involved in root cell elongation of rice.	Here, we functionally characterized an Al-inducible expansin gene, OsEXPA10, which is regulated by a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor, ART1 in rice
ART1	OsFRDL4	Retrotransposon-mediated aluminum tolerance through enhanced expression of the citrate transporter OsFRDL4.	2-kb insertion in the OsFRDL4 promoter region in japonica subspecies is responsible for their higher expression level of OsFRDL4 due to the increased number of cis-acting elements of ART1
ART1	OsWRKY22	Transcription factor WRKY22 promotes aluminum tolerance via activation of OsFRDL4 expression and enhancement of citrate secretion in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Finally, we find that both OsFRDL4 expression and Al-induced citrate secretion are significantly lower in art1 oswrky22 double mutants than in the respective single mutants
