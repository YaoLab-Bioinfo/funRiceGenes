10.1007-s001220051098.pdf	Genetic analysis of rice grain quality	1999	TAG Theoretical and Applied Genetics	Institute of Genetics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China	The inheritance of grain quality is more complicated than that of other agronomic traits in cereals due to epistasis, maternal and cytoplasmic effects, and the triploid nature of endosperm. In the present study, an established rice DH population derived from anther culture of an indica/japonica hybrid was used for genetic analysis of rice grain quality. A total of five parameters, amylose content (AC), alkali-spreading score (ASS), gel consistency (GC), percentage of grain with a white core (PGWC) and the square of the white core (SWC), were estimated for the DH lines and the parent varieties. For each parent, the value of each parameter was relatively stable in three locations, Beijing, Hangzhou and Chengdu, while the differences between the parents were significant for all five parameters. AC showed a bimodal distribution, and the distribution of ASS was skewed toward the value of JX17, while the other three parameters displayed continuous distributions among the DH lines with partially transgressive segregations. For AC, a minor and a major gene were found on chromosomes 5 and 6 respectively. The major gene, which should be an allele of wx, explained 91.9% of the total variation. For GC, two QTLs were identified on chromosomes 2 and 7 respectively. For ASS, a minor and a major gene were both located on chromosome 6. The major gene should be the same locus as the alkali degeneration gene (alk). Genetic linkage between alk and wx was found in QTL mapping. For PGWC, two QTLs were located on chromosomes 8 and 12. Only a minor QTL was found for SWC on chromosome 3. The results and the molecular markers presented here may be useful in rice breeding for grain quality improvement.
ert187.pdf	OsbZIP58, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, regulates starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm	2013	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, PR China.	Starch composition and the amount in endosperm, both of which contribute dramatically to seed yield, cooking quality, and taste in cereals, are determined by a series of complex biochemical reactions. However, the mechanism regulating starch biosynthesis in cereal seeds is not well understood. This study showed that OsbZIP58, a bZIP transcription factor, is a key transcriptional regulator controlling starch synthesis in rice endosperm. OsbZIP58 was expressed mainly in endosperm during active starch synthesis. osbzip58 null mutants displayed abnormal seed morphology with altered starch accumulation in the white belly region and decreased amounts of total starch and amylose. Moreover, osbzip58 had a higher proportion of short chains and a lower proportion of intermediate chains of amylopectin. Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, OsSSIIa, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression. These findings indicate that OsbZIP58 functions as a key regulator of starch synthesis in rice seeds and provide new insights into seed quality control.
g11-010.pdf	Double repression of soluble starch synthase genes SSIIa and SSIIIa in rice (Oryza sativa L.) uncovers interactive effects on the physicochemical properties of starch	2011	Genome	Institute of Crop Science and the National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Soluble starch synthases (SSs) are major enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis in developing rice (Oryza sativa L.) endosperm. Despite extensive studies of SSs in various plant species including rice, the functional modes of action among multiple SS genes are still not clear. Here, we generated transgenic RNA interference (RNAi) repressed lines for seven of the eight members of the rice SS gene family and studied their effects on starch synthesis and grain formation. Consistent with their expression domains, RNAi repression of genes that encode isozymes SSI, SSIIa, and SSIIIa had strong effects on grain development, whereas no obvious phenotypic changes were observed in transgenic plants with the other SS genes being RNAi repressed, indicating functional redundancies among the genes. To study the potential functional interactions of SS genes, we generated SSIIa/SSIIIa double repression lines whose kernels displayed a chalky kernel appearance and had increased amylose levels, increased pasting temperatures, and decreased viscosities. The double mutation also reduced short (degree of polymerization (DP) 5-6) and long (DP 12-23) amylopectin chain contents in the grain and increased the medium long types (DP 7-11). The nonadditive nature of the double mutation line suggests that SSIIa and SSIIIa interact with each other during starch synthesis. Such interaction may be physical via starch phophorylase as indicated by our pair-wise yeast two-hybrid assays on major starch synthesis enzymes. Collectively, the data showed that SSIIa and SSIIIa play distinctive, but partially overlapping, roles during rice grain starch synthesis. The possibility of extensive redundancy or complementarity among SS isozymes is discussed.

The rice (Oryza sativa L.) basic leucine Zipper factor RISBZ1 and rice prolamin box binding factor (RPBF) are transcriptional activators of rice seed storage protein (SSP) genes in vivo. To ascertain the functions of these trans-activators in seed development, knock-down (KD) transgenic rice plants were generated in which the accumulation of RISBZ1 and RPBF was reduced in an endosperm-specific manner by co-suppression (KD-RISBZ1 and KD-RPBF). The accumulation of most SSPs changed little between individual KD mutants and wild-type plants, whereas a double KD mutant (KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF) resulted in a significant reduction of most SSP gene expression and accumulation. The reduction of both trans-activators also caused a greater reduction in seed starch accumulation than individual KD mutants. Storage lipids were accumulated at reduced levels in KD-RISBZ1 and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF seeds. KD-RPBF and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF seeds exhibited multi-layered aleurone cells. Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF. These phenotypes suggest that combinatorial interactions between RISBZ1 and RPBF play an essential role during grain filling. The functional redundancy and compensation between RISBZ1 and RPBF possibly account for weak effects on the SSP levels in single KD mutants, and help maintain various processes during seed development in rice. Physical interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF may ensure that these processes are carried out properly.
j.1469-8137.2010.03495.x.pdf	Association between nonsynonymous mutations of starch synthase IIa and starch quality in rice (Oryza sativa)	2011	New Phytol	Department of Biology, Washington University of St. Louis, Missouri, 63130, USA Present address: Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology Research, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, 20742, USA. guoqinyu@umd.edu	Starch quality is one of the most important agronomic traits in Asian rice, Oryza sativa. Starch synthase IIa (SsIIa) is a major candidate gene for starch quality variation. Within SsIIa, three nonsynonymous mutations in exon 8 have been shown to affect enzyme activity when expressed in Escherichia coli. To search for the variation in SsIIa that is responsible for starch quality variation in rice, we sequenced the SsIIa exon 8 region and measured starch quality as starch disintegration in alkali for 289 accessions of cultivated rice and 57 accessions of its wild ancestor, Oryza rufipogon. A general linear model and nested clade analysis were used to identify the associations between the three nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and starch quality. Among the three nonsynonymous SNPs, we found strong evidence of association at one nucleotide site ('SNP 3'), corresponding to a Leu/Phe replacement at codon 781. A second SNP, corresponding to a Val/Met replacement at codon 737, could potentially show an association with increased sample sizes. Variation in SsIIa enzyme activity is associated with the cohesiveness of rice grains when cooked, and our findings are consistent with selection for more cohesive grains during the domestication of tropical japonica rice.
j.1744-7909.2011.01065.x.pdf	ALK, the key gene for gelatinization temperature, is a modifier gene for gel consistency in rice	2011	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, Hangzhou 310006, China.	Gelatinization temperature (GT) is an important parameter in evaluating the cooking and eating quality of rice. Indeed, the phenotype, biochemistry and inheritance of GT have been widely studied in recent times. Previous map-based cloning revealed that GT was controlled by ALK gene, which encodes a putative soluble starch synthase II-3. Complementation vector and RNAi vector were constructed and transformed into Nipponbare mediated by Agrobacterium. Phenotypic and molecular analyses of transgenic lines provided direct evidence for ALK as a key gene for GT. Meanwhile, amylose content, gel consistency and pasting properties were also affected in transgenic lines. Two of four nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in coding sequence of ALK were identified as essential for GT. Based on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), two new sets of SNP markers combined with one cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker were developed for application in rice quality breeding.
srep00557.pdf	SNP in starch biosynthesis genes associated with nutritional and functional properties of rice	2012	Sci Rep	Southern Cross Plant Science, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia.	Starch is a major component of human diets. The relative contribution of variation in the genes of starch biosynthesis to the nutritional and functional properties of the rice was evaluated in a rice breeding population. Sequencing 18 genes involved in starch synthesis in a population of 233 rice breeding lines discovered 66 functional SNPs in exonic regions. Five genes, AGPS2b, Isoamylase1, SPHOL, SSIIb and SSIVb showed no polymorphism. Association analysis found 31 of the SNP were associated with differences in pasting and cooking quality properties of the rice lines. Two genes appear to be the major loci controlling traits under human selection in rice, GBSSI (waxy gene) and SSIIa. GBSSI influenced amylose content and retrogradation. Other genes contributing to retrogradation were GPT1, SSI, BEI and SSIIIa. SSIIa explained much of the variation in cooking characteristics. Other genes had relatively small effects.
NA	Characteristics of Grain Physicochemical Properties and the Starch Structure in Rice Carrying a Mutated ALK/SSIIa Gene	2020	J Agric Food Chem	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China.	The gelatinization temperature (GT) of endosperm starch influences rice eating and the cooking quality (ECQ). ALK encoding soluble starch synthase IIa (SSIIa) is the major gene determining grain GT in rice. Herein, we identified a spontaneous ALK mutant named ALKd, which resulted from a G/T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 1 of the ALKc allele from the high-GT indica rice cultivar. Compared with grains from the ALKc near-isogenic line (NIL), NIL(ALKd) grains exhibited a high GT (2.3 °„C) and improved retrogradation properties. The NIL(ALKd) grain starch contained an increased proportion of amylopectin intermediate chains (DP 13-24) at the expense of short chains (DP < 12), resulting in enhancements in both the crystallinity and the lamellar peak intensity compared with low-GT rice grains. Moreover, both NIL(ALKd) and NIL(ALKc) grains also featured a significantly lower apparent amylose content (AAC), harder gel consistency (GC), higher pasting curve, and poorer taste values in comparison to Nip(ALKa) grains. Taken together, this work provides novel insights underlying the allelic variation of the ALK gene in rice.
NA	Genomic Regions Involved in Differences in Eating and Cooking Quality Other than Wx and Alk Genes between indica and japonica Rice Cultivars	2021	Rice (N Y)	Institute of Crop Science, NARO, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8518, Japan. horikiyo@affrc.go.jp.	Background: In temperate rice cultivation regions, japonica rice cultivars are grown preferentially because consumers deem them to have good eating quality, whereas indica rice cultivars have high grain yields and strong heat tolerance but are considered to have poor eating quality. To mitigate the effects of global warming on rice production, it is important to develop novel rice cultivars with both desirable eating quality and resilience to high temperatures. Eating quality and agronomic traits were evaluated in a reciprocal set of chromosome segment substitution lines derived from crosses between a japonica rice cultivar 'Koshihikari' and an indica rice cultivar 'Takanari'.  Results: We detected 112 QTLs for amylose and protein contents, whiteness, stickiness, hardness and eating quality of cooked rice grains. Almost of 'Koshihikari' chromosome segments consistently improved eating quality. Among detected QTLs, six QTLs on chromosomes 1-5 and 11 were detected that increased whiteness and stickiness of cooked grains or decreased their hardness for 3 years. The QTLs on chromosomes 2-4 were not associated with differences in amylose or protein contents. QTLs on chromosomes 1-5 did not coincide with QTLs for agronomic traits such as heading date, culm length, panicle length, spikelet fertility and grain yield. Genetic effects of the detected QTLs were confirmed in substitution lines carrying chromosome segments from five other indica cultivars in the 'Koshihikari' genetic background.  Conclusion: The detected QTLs were associated with differences in eating quality between indica and japonica rice cultivars. These QTLs appear to be widely distributed among indica cultivars and to be novel genetic factors for eating quality traits because their chromosome regions differed from those of the GBSSI (Wx) and SSIIa (Alk) genes. The detected QTLs would be very useful for improvement of eating quality of indica rice cultivars in breeding programs.
