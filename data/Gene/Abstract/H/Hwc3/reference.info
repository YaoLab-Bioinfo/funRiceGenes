NA	A novel discovery of an LTR retrotransposon-induced hybrid weakness in rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	Rice Research Institute, Yunnan Agriculture University, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, China.	Hybrid weakness is a post-zygotic hybridization barrier frequently observed in plants, including rice. In this study, we describe the genomic variation among three temperate japonica rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) varieties 'Aranghyangchalbyeo' ('CH7'), 'Sanghaehyangheolua' ('CH8') and 'Shinseonchalbyeo' ('CH9'), carrying different hybrid weakness genes. The reciprocal progenies obtained from crossing any two varieties displayed characteristic hybrid weakness traits. We mapped and cloned a new locus, Hwc3 (hybrid weakness 3), on chromosome 4. Sequence analysis identified that an LTR retrotransposon was inserted into the promoter region of the Hwc3 gene in CH7. A 4-kb DNA fragment from CH7 containing the Hwc3 gene with the inserted LTR retrotransposon was able to induce hybrid weakness in hybrids with CH8 plants carrying the Hwc1 gene by genetic complementation. We investigated the differential gene expression profile of F1 plants exhibiting hybrid weakness and detected that the genes associated with energy metabolism were significantly down-regulated compared to the parents. Based on our results, we propose that LTR retrotransposons could be a potential cause of hybrid weakness in intra-subspecific hybrids in japonica rice. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying intra-subspecific hybrid weakness has significance for increasing our knowledge on reproductive isolation and could have significant implications for rice improvement and hybrid breeding.
