NA	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	2018	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101 Beijing, China.	During meiosis, the number of double-strand breaks (DSBs) far exceeds the final number of crossovers (COs). Therefore, to identify proteins involved in determining which of these DSBs repaired into COs is critical in understanding the mechanism of CO control. Across species, HEI10-related proteins play important roles in CO formation. Here, through screening for HEI10-interacting proteins via a yeast two-hybrid system, we identify a CO protein HEI10 Interaction Protein 1 (HEIP1) in rice. HEIP1 colocalizes with HEI10 in a dynamic fashion along the meiotic chromosomes and specially localizes onto crossover sites from late pachytene to diplotene. Between these two proteins, HEI10 is required for the loading of HEIP1, but not vice versa. Moreover, mutations of the HEIP1 gene cause the severe reduction of chiasma frequency, whereas early homologous recombination processes are not disturbed and synapsis proceeds normally. HEIP1 interacts directly with ZIP4 and MSH5. In addition, the loading of HEIP1 depends on ZIP4, but not on MER3, MSH4, or MSH5. Together, our results suggest that HEIP1 may be a member of the ZMM group and acts as a key element regulating CO formation.
NA	The plant-specific gene ABERRANT GAMETOGENESIS 1 is essential for meiosis in rice.	2019	J Exp Bot	Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Plant Development, School of Life Sciences, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.	Meiotic recombination plays a central role in maintaining genome stability and increasing genetic diversity. Although meiotic progression and core components are widely conserved across kingdoms, significant differences remain among species. Here we identified a rice gene ABERRANT GAMETOGENESIS 1 (OsAGG1) that controls both male and female gametogenesis. Cytological and immunostaining analysis showed that, in osagg1 mutant, the early recombination processes and synapsis occurred normally, but the chiasma number was dramatically reduced. Moreover, OsAGG1 was found to interact with ZMM proteins OsHEI10, OsZIP4 and OsMSH5. These results suggested that OsAGG1 played an important role in crossover (CO) formation. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OsAGG1 is a plant-specific protein with a highly conserved N-terminal region. Further genetic and protein interaction analyses revealed that the conserved N-terminus was essential for the OsAGG1 protein function. Overall, our work showed that OsAGG1 is a novel and critical component for rice meiotic CO formation, thus expanding our understanding of meiotic progression.
