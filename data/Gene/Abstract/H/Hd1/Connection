We demonstrate that a histone fold domain scaffold formed by GRAIN YIELD, PLANT HEIGHT AND HEADING DATE 8 (Ghd8) and several NF-YC subunits can accommodate distinct proteins, including Hd1 and PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 37 (PRR37), and that the resulting OsNF-Y complex containing Hd1 can bind a specific sequence in the promoter of HEADING DATE 3A (Hd3a)
Hd1	OsMADS7|OsMADS45	Ectopic expression of OsMADS45 activates the upstream genes Hd3a and RFT1 at an early development stage causing early flowering in rice.	 We introduce an OsMADS45 overexpression construct Ubi:OsMADS45 into TNG67 plants (an Hd1 (Heading date 1) and Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) defective rice cultivar grown in Taiwan), and we analyzed the expression patterns of various floral regulators to understand the regulation pathways affected by OsMADS45 expression
Hd1	OsMADS7|OsMADS45	Ectopic expression of OsMADS45 activates the upstream genes Hd3a and RFT1 at an early development stage causing early flowering in rice.	 OsMADS45 overexpression did not alter the oscillating rhythm of the examined floral regulatory genes but advanced (by approximately 20<U+00A0>days) the up-regulate of two florigens, Hd3a (Heading Date 3a) and RFT1 (RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1) and suppressed the expression of Hd1 at the juvenile stage
Hd1	OsMADS7|OsMADS45	Ectopic expression of OsMADS45 activates the upstream genes Hd3a and RFT1 at an early development stage causing early flowering in rice.	 OsMADS45 overexpression did not influence other floral regulator genes upstream of Hd1 and Ehd1, such as OsGI (OsGIGANTEA), Ehd2/Osld1/RID1 and OsMADS50
Hd1	Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8|CAR8|OsNF-YB11	The DTH8-Hd1 module mediates day length-dependent regulation of rice flowering.	 Here, we demonstrate that the repression of flowering in LD mediated by Hd1 is dependent on the transcription factor DAYS TO HEADING 8 (DTH8)
Hd1	Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8|CAR8|OsNF-YB11	The DTH8-Hd1 module mediates day length-dependent regulation of rice flowering.	 Loss of DTH8 function results in the activation of Hd3a by Hd1, leading to early flowering
Hd1	Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8|CAR8|OsNF-YB11	The DTH8-Hd1 module mediates day length-dependent regulation of rice flowering.	 We also show that Hd1 directly interacts with DTH8 and that the formation of the DTH8-Hd1 complex is necessary for the transcriptional repression of Hd3a by Hd1 in LD
Hd1	Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8|CAR8|OsNF-YB11	The DTH8-Hd1 module mediates day length-dependent regulation of rice flowering.	 We thus detected a switch in function of Hd1 mediated by DTH8 in LD rather than in SD
Hd1	Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8|CAR8|OsNF-YB11	The DTH8-Hd1 module mediates day length-dependent regulation of rice flowering.	 H3K27 trimethylation increases at Hd3a in the presence the DTH8-Hd1 complex, while Hd1 attenuates the H3K27me3 level in Hd3a when DTH8 function is lost
Hd1	Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8|CAR8|OsNF-YB11	The DTH8-Hd1 module mediates day length-dependent regulation of rice flowering.	 Therefore, our findings establish that, in response to day length, DTH8 plays a critical role in mediating Hd1 regulation of Hd3a transcription through the DTH8-Hd1 module to shape epigenetic marks in photoperiodic flowering
Ghd7	Hd1	Alternative functions of Hd1 in repressing or promoting heading are determined by Ghd7 status under long-day conditions.	Alternative functions of Hd1 in repressing or promoting heading are determined by Ghd7 status under long-day conditions.
Ghd7	Hd1	Alternative functions of Hd1 in repressing or promoting heading are determined by Ghd7 status under long-day conditions.	 Comparative analysis of two sets of near isogenic lines of Hd1 in MH63 and ZS97 backgrounds indicated that the alternative functions of Hd1 in promoting or suppressing heading under LD are dependent on the previously cloned flowering repressor gene Ghd7
Ghd7	Hd1	Alternative functions of Hd1 in repressing or promoting heading are determined by Ghd7 status under long-day conditions.	 The interaction between proteins Ghd7 and Hd1 occurred through binding of the CCT domain of Ghd7 to the transcription-activating domain of Hd1, resulting in suppression of Ehd1 and florigen gene expression
Ghd7	Hd1	Alternative functions of Hd1 in repressing or promoting heading are determined by Ghd7 status under long-day conditions.	 These findings suggest that Hd1 alone essentially acts as a promoter of heading date, and the protein interaction between Ghd7 and Hd1 determines photoperiod sensitivity and integrated Hd1-mediated and Ehd1-mediated flowering pathways in rice
CKI|EL1|Hd16	Hd1	Fine-tuning of the setting of critical day length by two casein kinases in rice photoperiodic flowering.	 In addition, we determined that Hd16 functions as an enhancer of the bifunctional action of Hd1 (the Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) in rice
Ghd7	Hd1	Genetic interaction involving photoperiod-responsive Hd1 promotes early flowering under long-day conditions in rice.	 Based on the phenotypic and genotypic data of the NILs, and NIL mapping population and the transcript abundance of key flowering pathway genes, we conclude that Hd1 and its interaction with a novel gene other than Ghd7 play an important role in controlling flowering under LD conditions
Hd1	OsIDS1	Histone Deacetylase 701 (HDT701) Induces Flowering in Rice by Modulating Expression of OsIDS1.	 Transcript levels of OsINDETERMINATE SPIKELET 1 (OsIDS1), an upstream repressor of Ehd1, were significantly increased in the mutants while those of OsGI and Hd1 were reduced
Hd1	OsPHL3	Identification of a G2-like transcription factor, OsPHL3, functions as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by co-expression and reverse genetic analysis.	 Further analysis indicated that OsPHL3 delayed flowering time by down-regulating the expression of Hd3a and RFT1 through promoting Hd1 under long-day conditions (LDs), or suppressing Ehd1/Hd1 under short-day conditions (SDs)
