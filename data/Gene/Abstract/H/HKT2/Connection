HKT2	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa	We also isolated two cDNAs homologous to Ni-OsHKT1 from salt-tolerant indica rice, cv Pokkali (Po-OsHKT1, Po-OsHKT2)
HKT2	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa	The predicted amino acid sequence of Ni-OsHKT1 shares 100% identity with Po-OsHKT1 and 91% identity with Po-OsHKT2, and they are 66-67% identical to wheat HKT1
HKT2	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa	We further characterized the ion-transport properties of OsHKT1 and OsHKT2 using an expression system in the heterologous cells, yeast and Xenopus oocytes
HKT2	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa	OsHKT2 was capable of completely rescuing a K+-uptake deficiency mutation in yeast, whereas OsHKT1 was not under K+-limiting conditions
HKT2	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa	When OsHKTs were expressed in Na+-sensitive yeast, OsHKT1 rendered the cells more Na+-sensitive than did OsHKT2 in high NaCl conditions
HKT2	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	Two types of HKT transporters with different properties of Na+ and K+ transport in Oryza sativa	These results suggest that two isoforms of HKT transporters, a Na+ transporter (OsHKT1) and a Na+- and K+-coupled transporter (OsHKT2), may act harmoniously in the salt tolerant indica rice
