PGL1	PGL2|OsBUL1|OsbHLH173	An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG	These findings suggest that PGL2 and PGL1 redundantly suppress the function of APG by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of PGL2, controls grain length is independent of APG
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG	Previously, we have shown that an antagonistic pair of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1) and ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG), is involved in controlling rice grain length

GS3	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
PGL1	SRS3|OsKINESIN-13A	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	We identified the interaction partner of PGL1 and named it ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG)
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	PGL1 and APG interacted in vivo and localized in the nucleus
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	As expected, silencing of APG produced the same phenotype as overexpression of PGL1, suggesting antagonistic roles for the two genes
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
APG|OsPIL16	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	PGL1-APG represents a new grain length and weight-controlling pathway in which APG is a negative regulator whose function is inhibited by PGL1
