00-0412.pdf	Isolation and characterization of rice phytochrome A mutants	2001	Plant Cell	Department of Plant Physiology, National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. mtakano@abr.affrc.go.jp	To elucidate phytochrome A (phyA) function in rice, we screened a large population of retrotransposon (Tos17) insertional mutants by polymerase chain reaction and isolated three independent phyA mutant lines. Sequencing of the Tos17 insertion sites confirmed that the Tos17s interrupted exons of PHYA genes in these mutant lines. Moreover, the phyA polypeptides were not immunochemically detectable in these phyA mutants. The seedlings of phyA mutants grown in continuous far-red light showed essentially the same phenotype as dark-grown seedlings, indicating the insensitivity of phyA mutants to far-red light. The etiolated seedlings of phyA mutants also were insensitive to a pulse of far-red light or very low fluence red light. In contrast, phyA mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from wild type under continuous red light. Therefore, rice phyA controls photomorphogenesis in two distinct modes of photoperception--far-red light-dependent high irradiance response and very low fluence response--and such function seems to be unique and restricted to the deetiolation process. Interestingly, continuous far-red light induced the expression of CAB and RBCS genes in rice phyA seedlings, suggesting the existence of a photoreceptor(s) other than phyA that can perceive continuous far-red light in the etiolated seedlings.
1128.pdf	Molecular dissection of the roles of phytochrome in photoperiodic flowering in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa 277-8561, Japan.	Phytochromes mediate the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant. Recent molecular genetics studies have revealed a genetic network that enables the critical daylength response of florigen gene expression. Analyses using a rice phytochrome chromophore-deficient mutant, photoperiod sensitivity5, have so far revealed that within this network, phytochromes are required for expression of Grain number, plant height and heading date7 (Ghd7), a floral repressor gene in rice. There are three phytochrome genes in rice, but the roles of each phytochrome family member in daylength response have not previously been defined. Here, we revealed multiple action points for each phytochrome in the critical daylength response of florigen expression by using single and double phytochrome mutant lines of rice. Our results show that either phyA alone or a genetic combination of phyB and phyC can induce Ghd7 mRNA, whereas phyB alone causes some reduction in levels of Ghd7 mRNA. Moreover, phyB and phyA can affect Ghd7 activity and Early heading date1 (a floral inducer) activity in the network, respectively. Therefore, each phytochrome gene of rice has distinct roles, and all of the phytochrome actions coordinately control the critical daylength response of florigen expression in rice.
1187.pdf	The multiple contributions of phytochromes to the control of internode elongation in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. iwamas@nias.affrc.go.jp	Although phyAphyBphyC phytochrome-null mutants in rice (Oryza sativa) have morphological changes and exhibit internode elongation, even as seedlings, it is unknown how phytochromes contribute to the control of internode elongation. A gene for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO1), which is an ethylene biosynthesis gene contributing to internode elongation, was up-regulated in phyAphyBphyC seedlings. ACO1 expression was controlled mainly by phyA and phyB, and a histochemical analysis showed that ACO1 expression was localized to the basal parts of leaf sheaths of phyAphyBphyC seedlings, similar to mature wild-type plants at the heading stage, when internode elongation was greatly promoted. In addition, the transcription levels of several ethylene- or gibberellin (GA)-related genes were changed in phyAphyBphyC mutants, and measurement of the plant hormone levels indicated low ethylene production and bioactive GA levels in the phyAphyBphyC mutants. We demonstrate that ethylene induced internode elongation and ACO1 expression in phyAphyBphyC seedlings but not in the wild type and that the presence of bioactive GAs was necessary for these effects. These findings indicate that phytochromes contribute to multiple steps in the control of internode elongation, such as the expression of the GA biosynthesis gene OsGA3ox2, ACO1 expression, and the onset of internode elongation.
Genes Dev.-1992-Stockhaus-2364-72.pdf	Serine-to-alanine substitutions at the amino-terminal region of phytochrome A result in an increase in biological activity	1992	Genes Dev	Rockefeller University, Laboratory of Plant Molecular Biology, New York, New York 10021-6399.	We have used a tobacco transgenic plant system to assay the structure/function relationship of phytochrome A (phyA), a plant photoreceptor. The amino terminus of phyA from different plant species is very rich in serine residues. To investigate whether these serine residues are required for phytochrome function, the first 10 serine codons encoding amino acid residues 2-4, 10-14, 19, and 20 in the amino-terminal domain of the rice phyA gene (phyA) were changed to alanine codons. The mutant (S/A phyA), as well as the wild-type phyA cDNA, was placed under the control of the 35S promoter, and the chimeric genes were transferred into the tobacco genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing either wild-type or S/A phyA showed similar phenotypic alterations, including dwarfism and dark-green leaves. However, hypocotyl elongation experiments revealed that transgenic seedlings expressing S/A phyA showed a higher amplitude of the red light response with respect to the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. The observed difference is not correlated with expression levels of the transgene. The chromophore is attached to the mutant phyA apoprotein (PHY A), and the mutant photoreceptor is photoreversible, giving a difference spectrum indistinguishable from that of the rice phyA. Our results indicate that the S/A mutant has a higher biological activity as compared with the wild-type rice phyA.
Hirose-2012-Cryptochrome and phy.pdf	Cryptochrome and phytochrome cooperatively but independently reduce active gibberellin content in rice seedlings under light irradiation	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Photobiology and Photosynthesis Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan. fumih@affrc.go.jp	In contrast to a wealth of knowledge about the photoregulation of gibberellin metabolism in dicots, that in monocots remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that a blue light signal triggers reduction of active gibberellin content in rice seedlings with simultaneous repression of two gibberellin 20-oxidase genes (OsGA20ox2 and OsGA20ox4) and acute induction of four gibberellin 2-oxidase genes (OsGA2ox4-OsGA2ox7). For further examination of the regulation of these genes, we established a series of cryptochrome-deficient lines through reverse genetic screening from a Tos17 mutant population and construction of knockdown lines based on an RNA interference technique. By using these lines and phytochrome mutants, we elucidated that cryptochrome 1 (cry1), consisting of two species in rice plants (cry1a and cry1b), is indispensable for robust induction of the GA2ox genes. On the other hand, repression of the GA20ox genes is mediated by phytochromes. In addition, we found that the phytochromes also mediate the repression of a gibberellin 3-oxidase gene (OsGA3ox2) in the light. These results imply that, in rice seedlings, phytochromes mediate the repression of gibberellin biosynthesis capacity, while cry1 mediates the induction of gibberellin inactivation capacity. The cry1 action was demonstrated to be dominant in the reduction of active gibberellin content, but, in rice seedlings, the cumulative effects of these independent actions reduced active gibberellin content in the light. This pathway design in which different types of photoreceptors independently but cooperatively regulate active gibberellin content is unique from the viewpoint of dicot research. This redundancy should provide robustness to the response in rice plants.
j.1365-3040.2008.01790.x.pdf	Rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 is involved in phytochrome and jasmonate signalling	2008	Plant Cell Environ	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. michael.riemann@bio.uka.de	Jasmonic acid (JA) is an important negative regulator of light-regulated coleoptile elongation in rice. We isolated rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (osjar1) mutants from the Tos17 mutant panel by BLAST search. In far-red and blue lights, osjar1 coleoptiles were longer if compared with the wild type (WT), indicating that OsJar1 participates in the suppression of coleoptile elongation in these light conditions, while the mutant did not show a clear phenotype in red light. The analysis of OsJar1 expression in phytochrome (phy) mutants revealed that phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) act redundantly to induce this gene by red light, presumably. Unexpectedly, blue light-induced expression of OsJar1 gene was impaired in phyA-deficient mutants, indicating the involvement of phyA in the blue light signalling. In WT seedlings, OsJar1 transcripts were up-regulated transiently in response to treatment with exogenous methyl-jasmonic acid (MeJA). The dose-response curve of the MeJA treatment showed a characteristic pattern: concentrations as low as 4.5 nM could induce OsJar1 transcription, while the gene was superinduced at a concentration of 450 microM MeJA. In summary, this paper demonstrated that OsJar1 modulates light and JA signalling in the photomorphogenesis of rice.
j.1365-313X.1999.00440.x.pdf	The HMG-I/Y protein PF1 stimulates binding of the transcriptional activator GT-2 to the PHYA gene promoter	1999	The Plant Journal	Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley 94720, USA.	The DNA-binding proteins PF1 and GT-2 are factors that bind to different functionally defined, positively acting cis-elements in the PHYA genes of oat and rice, respectively. PF1 is an HMG-I/Y protein, with its cognate cis-element being an AT-rich sequence, designated PE1, whereas GT-2 is a transcriptional activator with twin DNA binding domains that recognize a triplet of GT-boxes in a complex motif designated GTE. To further define the DNA-binding activity of PF1 and to explore potential inter-relationships between the two factors, we have performed a series of in vitro DNA-binding experiments with both PE1 and GTE target sites. The data show that, consistent with its membership of the HMG-I/Y protein family, PF1 can bend DNA when bound to PE1. In addition, PF1 can bind promiscuously, with varying affinity, to other AT-containing motifs, including GTE. When co-incubated with GT-2, PF1 enhances the specific DNA-binding activity of GT-2 toward GTE, the first report of such activity for a plant HMG-I/Y protein. This enhancement takes place without demonstrable physical contact between the two proteins, suggesting the possibility of a novel, indirect mechanism of recruitment involving DNA target-site pre-conditioning. The evidence indicates therefore that PF1 and GT-2 do not perform functionally equivalent roles in positively regulating oat and rice PHYA gene expression. However, the data suggest the possibility that PF1 may act as an architectural factor, promiscuously recognizing a spectrum of AT-containing elements in plant promoters, with the general function of catalyzing enhanced binding of conventional cognate transcriptional regulators to these elements via DNA bending.
PNAS-2009-Takano-0907378106.pdf	Phytochromes are the sole photoreceptors for perceiving red/far-red light in rice	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. mtakano@affrc.go.jp	Phytochromes are believed to be solely responsible for red and far-red light perception, but this has never been definitively tested. To directly address this hypothesis, a phytochrome triple mutant (phyAphyBphyC) was generated in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) and its responses to red and far-red light were monitored. Since rice only has three phytochrome genes (PHYA, PHYB and PHYC), this mutant is completely lacking any phytochrome. Rice seedlings grown in the dark develop long coleoptiles while undergoing regular circumnutation. The phytochrome triple mutants also show this characteristic skotomorphogenesis, even under continuous red or far-red light. The morphology of the triple mutant seedlings grown under red or far-red light appears completely the same as etiolated seedlings, and they show no expression of the light-induced genes. This is direct evidence demonstrating that phytochromes are the sole photoreceptors for perceiving red and far-red light, at least during rice seedling establishment. Furthermore, the shape of the triple mutant plants was dramatically altered. Most remarkably, triple mutants extend their internodes even during the vegetative growth stage, which is a time during which wild-type rice plants never elongate their internodes. The triple mutants also flowered very early under long day conditions and set very few seeds due to incomplete male sterility. These data indicate that phytochromes play an important role in maximizing photosynthetic abilities during the vegetative growth stage in rice.
tpc1703311.pdf	Distinct and cooperative functions of phytochromes A, B, and C in the control of deetiolation and flowering in rice	2005	Plant Cell	Department of Plant Physiology, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. mtakano@nias.affrc.go.jp	We have isolated phytochrome B (phyB) and phyC mutants from rice (Oryza sativa) and have produced all combinations of double mutants. Seedlings of phyB and phyB phyC mutants exhibited a partial loss of sensitivity to continuous red light (Rc) but still showed significant deetiolation responses. The responses to Rc were completely canceled in phyA phyB double mutants. These results indicate that phyA and phyB act in a highly redundant manner to control deetiolation under Rc. Under continuous far-red light (FRc), phyA mutants showed partially impaired deetiolation, and phyA phyC double mutants showed no significant residual phytochrome responses, indicating that not only phyA but also phyC is involved in the photoperception of FRc in rice. Interestingly, the phyB phyC double mutant displayed clear R/FR reversibility in the pulse irradiation experiments, indicating that both phyA and phyB can mediate the low-fluence response for gene expression. Rice is a short-day plant, and we found that mutation in either phyB or phyC caused moderate early flowering under the long-day photoperiod, while monogenic phyA mutation had little effect on the flowering time. The phyA mutation, however, in combination with phyB or phyC mutation caused dramatic early flowering.
Ts-2 comprehensive metabolite profiling of phya phyb phyc triple mutants to reveal their associated metabolic phenotype in rice leaves.pdf	Comprehensive metabolite profiling of phyA phyB phyC triple mutants to reveal their associated metabolic phenotype in rice leaves	2009	J Biosci Bioeng	Department of Biotechnology, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.	The phytochrome photoreceptors regulate plant growth and development throughout their life cycle. Rice (Oryza sativa) possesses three phytochromes, phyA, phyB, and phyC. Physiological, genetic, and biochemical analyses of null mutants of each phytochrome have revealed the function of each in rice. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between phytochrome signaling and metabolism. In the present study, non-targeted metabolite analysis by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS) and targeted metabolite analysis by capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE/ESI-MS) were employed to investigate metabolic changes in rice phyA phyB phyC triple mutants. Distinct metabolic profiles between phyA phyB phyC triple mutants and the wild type (WT), as well as those between young and mature leaf blades, could be clearly observed by principal component analysis (PCA). The metabolite profiles indicated high accumulation of amino acids, organic acids, sugars, sugar phosphates, and nucleotides in the leaf blades of phyA phyB phyC triple mutants, especially in the young leaves, compared with those in the WT. Remarkable overaccumulation of monosaccharide, such as glucose (53.4-fold), fructose (42.5-fold), and galactose (24.5-fold), was observed in young leaves of phyA phyB phyC triple mutants. These metabolic phenotypes suggest that sugar metabolism, carbon partitioning, sugar transport, or some combination of these is impaired in the phyA phyB phyC triple mutants, and conversely, that phytochromes have crucial roles in sugar metabolism.
NA	OsPhyA modulates rice flowering time mainly through OsGI under short days and Ghd7 under long days in the absence of phytochrome B.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, 446-701, Korea.	Phytochromes recognize light signals and control diverse developmental processes. In rice, all three phytochrome genes-OsphyA, OsphyB, and OsphyC-are involved in regulating flowering time. We investigated the role of OsPhyA by comparing the osphyA osphyB double mutant to an osphyB single mutant. Plants of the double mutant flowered later than the single under short days (SD) but bolted earlier under long days (LD). Under SD, this delayed-flowering phenotype was primarily due to the decreased expression of Oryza sativa GIGANTEA (OsGI), which controls three flowering activators: Heading date 1 (Hd1), OsMADS51, and Oryza sativa Indeterminate 1 (OsId1). Under LD, although the expression of several repressors, e.g., Hd1, Oryza sativa CONSTANS-like 4 (OsCOL4), and AP2 genes, was affected in the double mutant, that of Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) was the most significantly reduced. These results indicated that OsPhyA influences flowering time mainly by affecting the expression of OsGI under SD and Ghd7 under LD when phytochrome B is absent. We also demonstrated that far-red light delays flowering time via both OsPhyA and OsPhyB.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
