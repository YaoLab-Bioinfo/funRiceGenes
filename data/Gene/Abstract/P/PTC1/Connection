OsTDF1	PTC1|OsMS1	The functional analysis of OsTDF1 reveals a conserved genetic pathway for tapetal development between rice and Arabidopsis	The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that OsTDF1 acts downstream of UDT1 and upstream of TDR, EAT1, OsMYB103 and PTC1 in rice, suggesting that the genetic pathway for tapetum development is generally conserved between rice and Arabidopsis
