PLA2|LHD2	PLA3|OsLBD3-7|OsLBD37	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase
PLA2|LHD2	PLA3|OsLBD3-7|OsLBD37	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology
PLA2|LHD2	PLA3|OsLBD3-7|OsLBD37	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	Double mutant analysis revealed that PLA1, PLA2 and PLA3 are regulated independently but function redundantly

Ehd1	PLA3|OsLBD3-7|OsLBD37	OsLBD37 and OsLBD38, two class II type LBD proteins, are involved in the regulation of heading date by controlling the expression of Ehd1 in rice.	OsLBD37 and OsLBD38, two class II type LBD proteins, are involved in the regulation of heading date by controlling the expression of Ehd1 in rice.
Ehd1	PLA3|OsLBD3-7|OsLBD37	OsLBD37 and OsLBD38, two class II type LBD proteins, are involved in the regulation of heading date by controlling the expression of Ehd1 in rice.	 Further analysis revealed that OsLBD37 and OsLBD38 delayed heading date by down-regulating the expression of the florigen genes Hd3a and RFT1 through key regulator of heading date Ehd1
