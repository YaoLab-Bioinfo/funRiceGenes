APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.
APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	Conversely, silencing of APIP10 in the Piz-t background causes cell death, significant accumulation of Piz-t, and enhanced resistance to M

APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	We show that APIP10 promotes degradation of Piz-t via the 26S proteasome system
APIP10	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The E3 Ligase APIP10 Connects the Effector AvrPiz-t to the NLR Receptor Piz-t in Rice.	Together, our results show that APIP10 is a novel E3 ligase that functionally connects the fungal effector AvrPiz-t to its NLR receptor Piz-t in rice
APIP5|OsbZIP53	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.	Conversely, Piz-t interacts with and stabilizes APIP5 to prevent necrosis at the necrotrophic stage

APIP12	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The Nup98 Homolog APIP12 Targeted by the Effector AvrPiz-t is Involved in Rice Basal Resistance Against Magnaporthe oryzae.	It is worth noting that neither knockout/knockdown nor overexpression of APIP12 attenuates Piz-t resistance
APIP4	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	A Fungal Effector and a Rice NLR Protein Have Antagonistic Effects on a Bowman-Birk Trypsin Inhibitor.	 By contrast, the rice NLR protein Piz-t interacted with APIP4£¬enhancing APIP4 transcript and protein levels, and protease inhibitor activity
OsVOZ1	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 Both OsVOZ1 and OsVOZ2Â interact with Piz-t
OsVOZ1	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	Two VOZ transcription factors link an E3 ligase and an NLR immune receptor to modulate immunity in rice.	 Double silencing of OsVOZ1 and OsVOZ2 in the Piz-t background decreases Piz-t protein accumulation and transcription, reactive oxygen species-dependent cell death, and resistance to M
OsWRKY62	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The ANIP1-OsWRKY62 module regulates both basal defense and Pi9-mediated immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.	 Moreover, ANIP1 physically associates with the rice WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY62, which also interacts with AvrPi9 and Pi9 in plants
OsWRKY62	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The ANIP1-OsWRKY62 module regulates both basal defense and Pi9-mediated immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.	 In the absence of Pi9, ANIP1 negatively regulates OsWRKY62 abundance, which can be promoted by AvrPi9
OsWRKY62	Pi9|Piz-t|Pi2	The ANIP1-OsWRKY62 module regulates both basal defense and Pi9-mediated immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.	 Pi9 binds to ANIP1 and OsWRKY62 to form a complex, which may help to keep Pi9 in an inactive state and weakenÂ rice immunity
