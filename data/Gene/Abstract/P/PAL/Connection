OsPAL	PAL|OsPAL4	Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.	OsPAL4 clusters with three additional OsPAL genes that co-localize with QTL for bacterial blight and sheath blight disease resistance on rice chromosome 2
OsCBSX3	PAL|OsPAL4	Over-Expression of Rice CBS Domain Containing Protein, OsCBSX3, Confers Rice Resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae Inoculation.	Consistently, the over-expression of OsCBSX3 enhances the transcript levels of immunity associated marker genes including PR1a, PR1b, PR5, AOS2, PAL, NH1, and OsWRKY13 in plants inoculated with M
Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	PAL|OsPAL4	Lsi1 modulates the antioxidant capacity of rice and protects against ultraviolet-B radiation.	 A further comparison of the transcript levels of individual PAL genes revealed that the expression of PAL2-2 (Os02g0626400) was positively regulated by Lsi1
OsPht1;8|OsPT8	PAL|OsPAL4	The Rice Phosphate Transporter Protein OsPT8 Regulates Disease Resistance and Plant Growth.	 Accordingly, the transcription level of resistance related genes, such as PAL and PBZ1, is inhibited in plants overexpressing OsPT8 (OsPT8-OX) after inoculation with these pathogens
