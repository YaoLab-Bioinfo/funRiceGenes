PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway	Rice PLASTOCHRON 1 (PLA1) and PLA2 genes regulate leaf maturation and plastochron, and their loss-of-function mutants exhibit small organs and rapid leaf emergence
PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway	Here, we investigated how PLA1 and PLA2 genes are related to phytohormones
PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway	We found that gibberellin (GA) is the major phytohormone that promotes PLA1 and PLA2 expression
PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway	GA induced PLA1 and PLA2 expression, and conversely the GA-inhibitor uniconazole suppressed PLA1 and PLA2 expression
PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway	In pla1-4 and pla2-1 seedlings, expression levels of GA biosynthesis genes and the signal transduction gene were similar to those in wild-type seedlings
PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway	GA treatment slightly down-regulated the GA biosynthesis gene GA20ox2 and up-regulated the GA-catabolizing gene GA2ox4, whereas the GA biosynthesis inhibitor uniconazole up-regulated GA20ox2 and down-regulated GA2ox4 both in wild-type and pla mutants, suggesting that the GA feedback mechanism is not impaired in pla1 and pla2
PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway	To reveal how GA signal transduction affects the expression of PLA1 and PLA2, PLA expression in GA-signaling mutants was examined
PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway	In GA-insensitive mutant, gid1 and less-sensitive mutant, Slr1-d1, PLA1 and PLA2 expression was down-regulated
PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway	On the other hand, the expression levels of PLA1 and PLA2 were highly enhanced in a GA-constitutive-active mutant, slr1-1, causing ectopic overexpression
PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	Rice PLASTOCHRON genes regulate leaf maturation downstream of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway	These results indicate that both PLA1 and PLA2 act downstream of the GA signal transduction pathway to regulate leaf development
NL1|SNFL1	PLA1	NECK LEAF 1, a GATA type transcription factor, modulates organogenesis by regulating the expression of multiple regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice	Genetic analysis demonstrated an interaction between nl1 and pla1, with NL1 acting upstream of PLA1
NL1|SNFL1	PLA1	NECK LEAF 1, a GATA type transcription factor, modulates organogenesis by regulating the expression of multiple regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice	The expression level and spatial pattern of PLA1 were found to be altered in the nl1 mutant
NL1|SNFL1	PLA1	NECK LEAF 1, a GATA type transcription factor, modulates organogenesis by regulating the expression of multiple regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice	On the basis of these findings, we propose that NL1 is an intrinsic factor that modulates and coordinates organogenesis through regulating the expression of PLA1 and other regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice
PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase
PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology
PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	Double mutant analysis revealed that PLA1, PLA2 and PLA3 are regulated independently but function redundantly
PLA1	PLA3|OsLBD3-7|OsLBD37	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase
PLA1	PLA3|OsLBD3-7|OsLBD37	PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice	However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology

PLA1	PLA2|LHD2	PLASTOCHRON2 Regulates Leaf Initiation and Maturation in Rice	We show that PLA2 normally acts to retard the rate of leaf maturation but does so independently of PLA1, which encodes a member of the P450 family
