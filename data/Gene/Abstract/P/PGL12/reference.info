NA	PALE-GREEN LEAF12 Encodes A Novel Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Required for Chloroplast Development and 16S rRNA processing in Rice.	2018	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Lab for Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, P. R. China.	Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins regulate organellar gene expression in plants, through their involvement in organellar RNA metabolism. In rice (Oryza sativa), 477 genes are predicted to encode PPR proteins; however, the majority of their functions remain unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a rice mutant, pale-green leaf12 (pgl12); at the seedling stage, pgl12 mutants had yellow-green leaves, which gradually turned pale green as the plants grew. The pgl12 mutant had significantly reduced chlorophyll contents and increased sensitivity to changes in temperature. A genetic analysis revealed that the pgl12 mutation is recessive and located within a single nuclear gene. Map-based cloning of PGL12, including a transgenic complementation test, confirmed the presence of a base substitution (C to T), generating a stop codon, within LOC_Os12g10184 in the pgl12 mutant. LOC_Os12g10184 encodes a novel PLS-type PPR protein containing 17 PPR motifs and targeting to the chloroplasts. A qRT-PCR analysis showed that PGL12 was expressed in various tissues, especially the leaves. We also showed that the transcript levels of several nuclear- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis were significantly altered in pgl12 mutants. The mutant exhibited defects in the 16S rRNA processing and splicing of the plastid transcript ndhA. Our results indicate that PGL12 is a new PLS-type PPR protein required for proper chloroplast development and 16S rRNA processing in rice.
