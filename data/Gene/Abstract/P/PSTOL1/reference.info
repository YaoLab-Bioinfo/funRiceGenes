Marker-assisted breeding is a very useful tool for breeders but still lags behind its potential because information on the effect of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in different genetic backgrounds and ideal molecular markers are unavailable. Here, we report on some first steps toward the validation and application of the major rice QTL Phosphate uptake 1 (Pup1) that confers tolerance of phosphorus (P) deficiency in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Based on the Pup1 genomic sequence of the tolerant donor variety Kasalath that recently became available, markers were designed that target (1) putative genes that are partially conserved in the Nipponbare reference genome and (2) Kasalath-specific genes that are located in a large insertion-deletion (INDEL) region that is absent in Nipponbare. Testing these markers in 159 diverse rice accessions confirmed their diagnostic value across genotypes and showed that Pup1 is present in more than 50% of rice accessions adapted to stress-prone environments, whereas it was detected in only about 10% of the analyzed irrigated/lowland varieties. Furthermore, the Pup1 locus was detected in more than 80% of the analyzed drought-tolerant rice breeding lines, suggesting that breeders are unknowingly selecting for Pup1. A hydroponics experiment revealed genotypic differences in the response to P deficiency between upland and irrigated varieties but confirmed that root elongation is independent of Pup1. Contrasting Pup1 near-isogenic lines (NILs) were subsequently grown in two different P-deficient soils and environments. Under the applied aerobic growth conditions, NILs with the Pup1 locus maintained significantly higher grain weight plant(-1) under P deprivation in comparison with intolerant sister lines without Pup1. Overall, the data provide evidence that Pup1 has the potential to improve yield in P-deficient and/or drought-prone environments and in diverse genetic backgrounds.
nature11346.pdf	The protein kinase Pstol1 from traditional rice confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency	2012	Nature	International Rice Research Institute, DAPO Box 7777 Metro, Manila 1301, Philippines.	As an essential macroelement for all living cells, phosphorus is indispensable in agricultural production systems. Natural phosphorus reserves are limited, and it is therefore important to develop phosphorus-efficient crops. A major quantitative trait locus for phosphorus-deficiency tolerance, Pup1, was identified in the traditional aus-type rice variety Kasalath about a decade ago. However, its functional mechanism remained elusive until the locus was sequenced, showing the presence of a Pup1-specific protein kinase gene, which we have named phosphorus-starvation tolerance 1 (PSTOL1). This gene is absent from the rice reference genome and other phosphorus-starvation-intolerant modern varieties. Here we show that overexpression of PSTOL1 in such varieties significantly enhances grain yield in phosphorus-deficient soil. Further analyses show that PSTOL1 acts as an enhancer of early root growth, thereby enabling plants to acquire more phosphorus and other nutrients. The absence of PSTOL1 and other genes-for example, the submergence-tolerance gene SUB1A-from modern rice varieties underlines the importance of conserving and exploring traditional germplasm. Introgression of this quantitative trait locus into locally adapted rice varieties in Asia and Africa is expected to considerably enhance productivity under low phosphorus conditions.
Plant Physiol.-2011-Chin-1202-16.pdf	Developing rice with high yield under phosphorus deficiency: Pup1 sequence to application	2011	Plant Physiol	International Rice Research Institute, Plant Breeding, Genetics, and Biotechnology Division, 7777 Metro Manila, Philippines.	The major quantitative trait locus (QTL) Phosphorus uptake1 (Pup1) confers tolerance of phosphorus deficiency in soil and is currently one of the most promising QTLs for the development of tolerant rice (Oryza sativa) varieties. To facilitate targeted introgression of Pup1 into intolerant varieties, the gene models predicted in the Pup1 region in the donor variety Kasalath were used to develop gene-based molecular markers that are evenly distributed over the fine-mapped 278-kb QTL region. To validate the gene models and optimize the markers, gene expression analyses and partial allelic sequencing were conducted. The markers were tested in more than 80 diverse rice accessions revealing three main groups with different Pup1 allele constitution. Accessions with tolerant (group I) and intolerant (group III) Pup1 alleles were distinguished from genotypes with Kasalath alleles at some of the analyzed loci (partial Pup1; group II). A germplasm survey additionally confirmed earlier data showing that Pup1 is largely absent from irrigated rice varieties but conserved in varieties and breeding lines adapted to drought-prone environments. A core set of Pup1 markers has been defined, and sequence polymorphisms suitable for single-nucleotide polymorphism marker development for high-throughput genotyping were identified. Following a marker-assisted backcrossing approach, Pup1 was introgressed into two irrigated rice varieties and three Indonesian upland varieties. First phenotypic evaluations of the introgression lines suggest that Pup1 is effective in different genetic backgrounds and environments and that it has the potential to significantly enhance grain yield under field conditions.
NA	Phosphate acquisition efficiency and phosphate starvation tolerance locus (PSTOL1) in rice.	2014	J Genet	Department of Genetics, Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Mohanpur, Nadia 741 252, India. somnathbhat@yahoo.com.	Phosphate availability is a major factor limiting tillering, grain filling vis-á-vis productivity of rice. Rice is often cultivated in soil like red and lateritic or acid, with low soluble phosphate content. To identify the best genotype suitable for these types of soils, P acquisition efficiency was estimated from 108 genotypes. Gobindabhog, Tulaipanji, Radhunipagal and Raghusail accumulated almost equal amounts of phosphate even when they were grown on P-sufficient soil. Here, we have reported the presence as well as the expression of a previously characterized rice gene, phosphate starvation tolerance locus (PSTOL1) in a set of selected genotypes. Two of four genotypes did not show any detectable expression but carried the gene. One mega cultivar, Swarna did not possess this gene but showed high P-deficiency tolerance ability. Increase of root biomass, not length, in P-limiting situations might be considered as one of the selecting criteria at the seedling stage. Neither the presence of PSTOL1 gene nor its closely-linked SSR RM1261, showed any association with P-deficiency tolerance among the 108 genotypes. Not only this, but the presence of PSTOL1 in recombinant inbred line (RIL) developed from a cross between Gobindabhog and Satabdi, also did not show any linkage with P-deficiency tolerance ability. Thus, before considering PSTOL1 gene in MAB, its expression and role in P-deficiency tolerance in the donor parent must be ascertained.
NA	Multiple interval QTL mapping and searching for PSTOL1 homologs associated with root morphology, biomass accumulation and phosphorus content in maize seedlings under low-P.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	Departamento de Biologia Geral, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Avenida Presidente Antônio Carlos, 6627, Belo Horizonte, MG, 31270-901, Brazil. gabrielcorradiazevedo@yahoo.com.br.	Modifications in root morphology are important strategies to maximize soil exploitation under phosphorus starvation in plants. Here, we used two multiple interval models to map QTLs related to root traits, biomass accumulation and P content in a maize RIL population cultivated in nutrient solution. In addition, we searched for putative maize homologs to PSTOL1, a gene responsible to enhance early root growth, P uptake and grain yield in rice and sorghum.Based on path analysis, root surface area was the root morphology component that most strongly contributed to total dry weight and to P content in maize seedling under low-P availability. Multiple interval mapping models for single (MIM) and multiple traits (MT-MIM) were combined and revealed 13 genomic regions significantly associated with the target traits in a complementary way. The phenotypic variances explained by all QTLs and their epistatic interactions using MT-MIM (23.4 to 35.5 %) were higher than in previous studies, and presented superior statistical power. Some of these QTLs were coincident with QTLs for root morphology traits and grain yield previously mapped, whereas others harbored ZmPSTOL candidate genes, which shared more than 55 % of amino acid sequence identity and a conserved serine/threonine kinase domain with OsPSTOL1. Additionally, four ZmPSTOL candidate genes co-localized with QTLs for root morphology, biomass accumulation and/or P content were preferentially expressed in roots of the parental lines that contributed the alleles enhancing the respective phenotypes.QTL mapping strategies adopted in this study revealed complementary results for single and multiple traits with high accuracy. Some QTLs, mainly the ones that were also associated with yield performance in other studies, can be good targets for marker-assisted selection to improve P-use efficiency in maize. Based on the co-localization with QTLs, the protein domain conservation and the coincidence of gene expression, we selected novel maize genes as putative homologs to PSTOL1 that will require further validation studies.
NA	Novel Alleles of Phosphorus-Starvation Tolerance 1 Gene (PSTOL1) from Oryza rufipogon Confers High Phosphorus Uptake Efficiency.	2017	Front Plant Sci	School of Agricultural Biotechnology, Punjab Agricultural UniversityLudhiana, India.	Limited phosphorus availability in the soil is one of the major constraints to the growth and productivity of rice across Asian, African and South American countries, where 50% of the rice is grown under rain-fed systems on poor and problematic soils. With an aim to determine novel alleles for enhanced phosphorus uptake efficiency in wild species germplasm of rice Oryza rufipogon, we investigated phosphorus uptake1 (Pup1) locus with 11 previously reported SSR markers and sequence characterized the phosphorus-starvation tolerance 1 (PSTOL1) gene. In the present study, we screened 182 accessions of O. rufipogon along with Vandana as a positive control with SSR markers. From the analysis, it was inferred that all of the O. rufipogon accessions undertaken in this study had an insertion of 90 kb region, including Pup1-K46, a diagnostic marker for PSTOL1, however, it was absent among O. sativa cv. PR114, PR121, and PR122. The complete PSTOL1 gene was also sequenced in 67 representative accessions of O. rufipogon and Vandana as a positive control. From comparative sequence analysis, 53 mutations (52 SNPs and 1 nonsense mutation) were found in the PSTOL1 coding region, of which 28 were missense mutations and 10 corresponded to changes in the amino acid polarity. These 53 mutations correspond to 17 haplotypes, of these 6 were shared and 11 were scored only once. A major shared haplotype was observed among 44 accessions of O. rufipogon along with Vandana and Kasalath. Out of 17 haplotypes, accessions representing 8 haplotypes were grown under the phosphorus-deficient conditions in hydroponics for 60 days. Significant differences were observed in the root length and weight among all the genotypes when grown under phosphorus deficiency conditions as compared to the phosphorus sufficient conditions. The O. rufipogon accession IRGC 106506 from Laos performed significantly better, with 2.5 times higher root weight and phosphorus content as compared to the positive control Vandana. In terms of phosphorus uptake efficiency, the O. rufipogon accessions IRGC 104639, 104712, and 105569 also showed nearly two times higher phosphorus content than Vandana. Thus, these O. rufipogon accessions could be used as the potential donor for improving phosphorus uptake efficiency of elite rice cultivars.
NA	Genetic enhancement of phosphorus starvation tolerance through marker assisted introgression of OsPSTOL1 gene in rice genotypes harbouring bacterial blight and blast resistance.	2018	PLoS One	Centre for Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, India.	Phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient, is a prerequisite for various plant-growth mechanisms including root establishment/development, early/late vegetative stage development and reproductive stage development. Rice (Oryza sativa) is very sensitive to P starvation. Most cultivated genotypes have poor tolerance levels to P deficiency and consequently the grain yield is severely affected by P starvation. Since P deficiency of soils is a major concern of rice production areas, it is necessary to develop new cultivars with enhanced P tolerance. This is also an expectation of farmers and the Agriculture ministry of southern states of India where rice cultivation is intensive. Our objective was to introgress the phosphorus starvation tolerance (OsPSTOL1) gene through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) in to two intermediate genetic stocks of popular local-varieties namely, ASD 16 and ADT 43 which harbour bacterial blight and blast resistance (R) genes. To delve into the P starvation phenotypic effect, we have generated a set of four backcross inbred lines (BILs) with enhanced P starvation tolerance. The developed BILs showed altered root architecture pattern and greater root surface area with increased P uptake, confirming their adaptability to P deficient soil conditions. Further, a correlation between root traits and low/high P conditions indicates the function of introgressed OsPSTOL1 in BILs. The enhanced root characteristics, therefore, enabled the plants to access and effectively absorb available nutrients from soil. In summary, the unique features of the OsPSTOL1 BILs with bacterial blight and blast resistance can aid varietal development suitable for cultivation in P deficient soils.
NA	A 1.84-Mb region on rice chromosome 2 carrying SPL4, SPL5 and MLO8 genes is associated with higher yield under phosphorus-deficient acidic soil	2021	J Appl Genet	School of Crop Improvement, College of Post Graduate Studies in Agricultural Sciences, Central Agricultural University (Imphal), Umiam, Meghalaya, India.	Phosphorus (P) deficiency is one of the major limiting factors for rice productivity with only one locus (PSTOL1) available for field based application. A biparental mapping population (F6) derived from two P deficiency tolerant genotypes (Sahbhagi Dhan (SD) (PSTOL1+) and Chakhao Poreiton (CP) (PSTOL1-)), in which, transcriptome data generated from our lab had previously shown existence of diverse mechanisms was used to identify novel regions for better yield under lowland acidic soils. Phenotyping at F4, F5 and F6 generations revealed significant correlation between traits like tiller number at 30 days (TN 30), tiller number at 60 days (TN 60), filled grains (FG), percent spikelet fertility (SF%), panicle number (PN) and grain yield per panicle (GYPP) and also association with better yield/performance under low P acidic soil conditions. Through selected genotyping on a set of forty superior and inferior lines using SSR, candidate gene-based and SNP polymorphic markers, 5 genomic regions associated with various yield-related traits were identified. Marker trait association studies revealed 13 markers significantly associated with yield attributing traits and PUE under lowland acidic field conditions. Chi-square and regression analyses of markers run on the entire population identified seven and six markers for SF% and GYPP, respectively, and two for biological yield with positive allele derived from SD which constitute a novel 1.847-Mb region on chromosome 2 flanked by two markers RM12550 and PR9-2. Expression analysis of 7 candidate genes lying within this region across SD, CP and two low P susceptible rice genotypes has revealed that expression of four genes including SPL4, SPL5, ACA9 and MLO8 is significantly upregulated only in SD under low P conditions. In CP, there is low expression of MLO8 under low P conditions, whereas SPL4, SPL5 and Os02g08120 are downregulated. In the case of the two susceptible genotypes, there is no expression of Os02g08120 either in optimum or limiting conditions. Sequence data across a panel of 3024 rice genotypes also suggests that there is polymorphism for these differentially expressed genes. The genes and underlying markers identified on chromosome 2 will be key to imparting tolerance to low P in diverse genetic backgrounds and for marker-assisted selection for higher yield under lowland acidic conditions.
