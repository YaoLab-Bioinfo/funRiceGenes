Phytochromes mediate the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant. Recent molecular genetics studies have revealed a genetic network that enables the critical daylength response of florigen gene expression. Analyses using a rice phytochrome chromophore-deficient mutant, photoperiod sensitivity5, have so far revealed that within this network, phytochromes are required for expression of Grain number, plant height and heading date7 (Ghd7), a floral repressor gene in rice. There are three phytochrome genes in rice, but the roles of each phytochrome family member in daylength response have not previously been defined. Here, we revealed multiple action points for each phytochrome in the critical daylength response of florigen expression by using single and double phytochrome mutant lines of rice. Our results show that either phyA alone or a genetic combination of phyB and phyC can induce Ghd7 mRNA, whereas phyB alone causes some reduction in levels of Ghd7 mRNA. Moreover, phyB and phyA can affect Ghd7 activity and Early heading date1 (a floral inducer) activity in the network, respectively. Therefore, each phytochrome gene of rice has distinct roles, and all of the phytochrome actions coordinately control the critical daylength response of florigen expression in rice.
1187.pdf	The multiple contributions of phytochromes to the control of internode elongation in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. iwamas@nias.affrc.go.jp	Although phyAphyBphyC phytochrome-null mutants in rice (Oryza sativa) have morphological changes and exhibit internode elongation, even as seedlings, it is unknown how phytochromes contribute to the control of internode elongation. A gene for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO1), which is an ethylene biosynthesis gene contributing to internode elongation, was up-regulated in phyAphyBphyC seedlings. ACO1 expression was controlled mainly by phyA and phyB, and a histochemical analysis showed that ACO1 expression was localized to the basal parts of leaf sheaths of phyAphyBphyC seedlings, similar to mature wild-type plants at the heading stage, when internode elongation was greatly promoted. In addition, the transcription levels of several ethylene- or gibberellin (GA)-related genes were changed in phyAphyBphyC mutants, and measurement of the plant hormone levels indicated low ethylene production and bioactive GA levels in the phyAphyBphyC mutants. We demonstrate that ethylene induced internode elongation and ACO1 expression in phyAphyBphyC seedlings but not in the wild type and that the presence of bioactive GAs was necessary for these effects. These findings indicate that phytochromes contribute to multiple steps in the control of internode elongation, such as the expression of the GA biosynthesis gene OsGA3ox2, ACO1 expression, and the onset of internode elongation.
Hirose-2012-Cryptochrome and phy.pdf	Cryptochrome and phytochrome cooperatively but independently reduce active gibberellin content in rice seedlings under light irradiation	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Photobiology and Photosynthesis Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan. fumih@affrc.go.jp	In contrast to a wealth of knowledge about the photoregulation of gibberellin metabolism in dicots, that in monocots remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that a blue light signal triggers reduction of active gibberellin content in rice seedlings with simultaneous repression of two gibberellin 20-oxidase genes (OsGA20ox2 and OsGA20ox4) and acute induction of four gibberellin 2-oxidase genes (OsGA2ox4-OsGA2ox7). For further examination of the regulation of these genes, we established a series of cryptochrome-deficient lines through reverse genetic screening from a Tos17 mutant population and construction of knockdown lines based on an RNA interference technique. By using these lines and phytochrome mutants, we elucidated that cryptochrome 1 (cry1), consisting of two species in rice plants (cry1a and cry1b), is indispensable for robust induction of the GA2ox genes. On the other hand, repression of the GA20ox genes is mediated by phytochromes. In addition, we found that the phytochromes also mediate the repression of a gibberellin 3-oxidase gene (OsGA3ox2) in the light. These results imply that, in rice seedlings, phytochromes mediate the repression of gibberellin biosynthesis capacity, while cry1 mediates the induction of gibberellin inactivation capacity. The cry1 action was demonstrated to be dominant in the reduction of active gibberellin content, but, in rice seedlings, the cumulative effects of these independent actions reduced active gibberellin content in the light. This pathway design in which different types of photoreceptors independently but cooperatively regulate active gibberellin content is unique from the viewpoint of dicot research. This redundancy should provide robustness to the response in rice plants.
PNAS-2009-Takano-0907378106.pdf	Phytochromes are the sole photoreceptors for perceiving red/far-red light in rice	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. mtakano@affrc.go.jp	Phytochromes are believed to be solely responsible for red and far-red light perception, but this has never been definitively tested. To directly address this hypothesis, a phytochrome triple mutant (phyAphyBphyC) was generated in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) and its responses to red and far-red light were monitored. Since rice only has three phytochrome genes (PHYA, PHYB and PHYC), this mutant is completely lacking any phytochrome. Rice seedlings grown in the dark develop long coleoptiles while undergoing regular circumnutation. The phytochrome triple mutants also show this characteristic skotomorphogenesis, even under continuous red or far-red light. The morphology of the triple mutant seedlings grown under red or far-red light appears completely the same as etiolated seedlings, and they show no expression of the light-induced genes. This is direct evidence demonstrating that phytochromes are the sole photoreceptors for perceiving red and far-red light, at least during rice seedling establishment. Furthermore, the shape of the triple mutant plants was dramatically altered. Most remarkably, triple mutants extend their internodes even during the vegetative growth stage, which is a time during which wild-type rice plants never elongate their internodes. The triple mutants also flowered very early under long day conditions and set very few seeds due to incomplete male sterility. These data indicate that phytochromes play an important role in maximizing photosynthetic abilities during the vegetative growth stage in rice.
tpc1703311.pdf	Distinct and cooperative functions of phytochromes A, B, and C in the control of deetiolation and flowering in rice	2005	Plant Cell	Department of Plant Physiology, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. mtakano@nias.affrc.go.jp	We have isolated phytochrome B (phyB) and phyC mutants from rice (Oryza sativa) and have produced all combinations of double mutants. Seedlings of phyB and phyB phyC mutants exhibited a partial loss of sensitivity to continuous red light (Rc) but still showed significant deetiolation responses. The responses to Rc were completely canceled in phyA phyB double mutants. These results indicate that phyA and phyB act in a highly redundant manner to control deetiolation under Rc. Under continuous far-red light (FRc), phyA mutants showed partially impaired deetiolation, and phyA phyC double mutants showed no significant residual phytochrome responses, indicating that not only phyA but also phyC is involved in the photoperception of FRc in rice. Interestingly, the phyB phyC double mutant displayed clear R/FR reversibility in the pulse irradiation experiments, indicating that both phyA and phyB can mediate the low-fluence response for gene expression. Rice is a short-day plant, and we found that mutation in either phyB or phyC caused moderate early flowering under the long-day photoperiod, while monogenic phyA mutation had little effect on the flowering time. The phyA mutation, however, in combination with phyB or phyC mutation caused dramatic early flowering.
Ts-2 comprehensive metabolite profiling of phya phyb phyc triple mutants to reveal their associated metabolic phenotype in rice leaves.pdf	Comprehensive metabolite profiling of phyA phyB phyC triple mutants to reveal their associated metabolic phenotype in rice leaves	2009	J Biosci Bioeng	Department of Biotechnology, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.	The phytochrome photoreceptors regulate plant growth and development throughout their life cycle. Rice (Oryza sativa) possesses three phytochromes, phyA, phyB, and phyC. Physiological, genetic, and biochemical analyses of null mutants of each phytochrome have revealed the function of each in rice. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between phytochrome signaling and metabolism. In the present study, non-targeted metabolite analysis by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS) and targeted metabolite analysis by capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE/ESI-MS) were employed to investigate metabolic changes in rice phyA phyB phyC triple mutants. Distinct metabolic profiles between phyA phyB phyC triple mutants and the wild type (WT), as well as those between young and mature leaf blades, could be clearly observed by principal component analysis (PCA). The metabolite profiles indicated high accumulation of amino acids, organic acids, sugars, sugar phosphates, and nucleotides in the leaf blades of phyA phyB phyC triple mutants, especially in the young leaves, compared with those in the WT. Remarkable overaccumulation of monosaccharide, such as glucose (53.4-fold), fructose (42.5-fold), and galactose (24.5-fold), was observed in young leaves of phyA phyB phyC triple mutants. These metabolic phenotypes suggest that sugar metabolism, carbon partitioning, sugar transport, or some combination of these is impaired in the phyA phyB phyC triple mutants, and conversely, that phytochromes have crucial roles in sugar metabolism.
NA	A base substitution in OsphyC disturbs its Interaction with OsphyB and affects flowering time and chlorophyll synthesis in rice.	2022	BMC Plant Biol	Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology, Ecology and Genetic Breeding, Ministry of Education, College of Agronomy, Jiangxi Agricultural University, 330045, Nanchang, China.	BACKGROUND: Phytochromes are important photoreceptors in plants, and play essential roles in photomorphogenesis. The functions of PhyA and PhyB in plants have been fully analyzed, while those of PhyC in plant are not well understood. RESULTS: A rice mutant, late heading date 3 (lhd3), was characterized, and the gene LHD3 was identified with a map-based cloning strategy. LHD3 encodes phytochrome C in rice. Animo acid substitution in OsphyC disrupted its interaction with OsphyB or itself, restraining functional forms of homodimer or heterodimer formation. Compared with wild-type plants, the lhd3 mutant exhibited delayed flowering under both LD (long-day) and SD (short-day) conditions, and delayed flowering time was positively associated with the day length via the Ehd1 pathway. In addition, lhd3 showed a pale-green-leaf phenotype and a slower chlorophyll synthesis rate during the greening process. The transcription patterns of many key genes involved in photoperiod-mediated flowering and chlorophyll synthesis were altered in lhd3. CONCLUSION: The dimerization of OsPhyC is important for its functions in the regulation of chlorophyll synthesis and heading. Our findings will facilitate efforts to further elucidate the function and mechanism of OsphyC and during light signal transduction in rice.
