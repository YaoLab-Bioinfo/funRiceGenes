NIGT1	nitrogen	A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice	 Furthermore, the chlorophyll content that could be a marker of nitrogen utilization was found to be decreased in NIGT1 overexpressors of rice grown with nitrate medium but not with ammonium medium
NIGT1	nitrogen	A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice	 Thus, we propose NIGT1 as a nitrate-inducible and autorepressible transcriptional repressor that may play a role in the nitrogen response in rice
NIGT1	nitrate	A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice	 Here we show that the supply of nitrate but not ammonium immediately induces the expression of a transcriptional repressor gene in rice, designated NIGT1 (Nitrate-Inducible, GARP-type Transcriptional Repressor 1)
NIGT1	nitrate	A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice	 Consistently, nitrate-induced NIGT1 expression was found to be down-regulated after a transient peak during nitrate treatment, and the nitrate-induced expression of NIGT1 decreased in transgenic rice plants in which this gene was constitutively overexpressed
NIGT1	nitrate	A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice	 Furthermore, the chlorophyll content that could be a marker of nitrogen utilization was found to be decreased in NIGT1 overexpressors of rice grown with nitrate medium but not with ammonium medium
NIGT1	nitrate	A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice	 Thus, we propose NIGT1 as a nitrate-inducible and autorepressible transcriptional repressor that may play a role in the nitrogen response in rice
NIGT1	nitrate	A nitrate-inducible GARP family gene encodes an auto-repressible transcriptional repressor in rice	 Taken together with the fact that the NIGT1-binding sites are conserved in promoter sequences of Arabidopsis NIGT1 homologs, our findings imply the presence of a time-dependent complex system for nitrate-responsive transcriptional regulation that is conserved in both monocots and dicots
