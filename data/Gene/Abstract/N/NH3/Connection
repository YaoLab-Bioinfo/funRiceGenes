NH3|OsNPR3	Xa5	OsNPR3.3-dependent salicylic acid signaling is involved in recessive gene xa5-mediated immunity to rice bacterial blight.	 Oryzae (Xoo) mediated by the recessive gene xa5, in which OsNPR3
NH3|OsNPR3	OsCUL3a	OsCUL3a-associated molecular switches have functions in cell metabolism, cell death, and disease resistance.	 Together, these results describe a network that regulates plant growth, disease resistance, and grain quality that includes the E3 ligase OsCUL3a, cell metabolism-associated molecular switches, and immunity switches OsNPR1 and OsNPR3
