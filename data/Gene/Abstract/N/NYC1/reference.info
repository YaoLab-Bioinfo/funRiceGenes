j.1365-313X.2008.03670.x.pdf	Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice	2009	Plant J	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.	Yellowing, which is related to the degradation of chlorophyll and chlorophyll-protein complexes, is a notable phenomenon during leaf senescence. NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 (NYC1) in rice encodes a membrane-localized short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) that is thought to represent a chlorophyll b reductase necessary for catalyzing the first step of chlorophyll b degradation. Analysis of the nyc1 mutant, which shows the stay-green phenotype, revealed that chlorophyll b degradation is required for the degradation of light-harvesting complex II and thylakoid grana in leaf senescence. Phylogenetic analysis further revealed the existence of NYC1-LIKE (NOL) as the most closely related protein to NYC1. In the present paper, the nol mutant in rice was also found to show a stay-green phenotype very similar to that of the nyc1 mutant, i.e. the degradation of chlorophyll b was severely inhibited and light-harvesting complex II was selectively retained during senescence, resulting in the retention of thylakoid grana even at a late stage of senescence. The nyc1 nol double mutant did not show prominent enhancement of inhibition of chlorophyll degradation. NOL was localized on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane despite the lack of a transmembrane domain. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NOL and NYC1 interact physically in vitro. These observations suggest that NOL and NYC1 are co-localized in the thylakoid membrane and act in the form of a complex as a chlorophyll b reductase in rice.
tpc1901362.pdf	Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence	2007	Plant Cell	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan. akusaba@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp	Chlorophyll degradation is an aspect of leaf senescence, which is an active process to salvage nutrients from old tissues. non-yellow coloring1 (nyc1) is a rice (Oryza sativa) stay-green mutant in which chlorophyll degradation during senescence is impaired. Pigment analysis revealed that degradation of not only chlorophylls but also light-harvesting complex II (LHCII)-bound carotenoids was repressed in nyc1, in which most LHCII isoforms were selectively retained during senescence. Ultrastructural analysis of nyc1 chloroplasts revealed that large and thick grana were present even in the late stage of senescence, suggesting that degradation of LHCII is required for the proper degeneration of thylakoid membranes. Map-based cloning of NYC1 revealed that it encodes a chloroplast-localized short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) with three transmembrane domains. The predicted structure of the NYC1 protein and the phenotype of the nyc1 mutant suggest the possibility that NYC1 is a chlorophyll b reductase. Although we were unable to detect the chlorophyll b reductase activity of NYC1, NOL (for NYC1-like), a protein closely related to NYC1 in rice, showed chlorophyll b reductase activity in vitro. We suggest that NYC1 and NOL encode chlorophyll b reductases with divergent functions. Our data collectively suggest that the identified SDR protein NYC1 plays essential roles in the regulation of LHCII and thylakoid membrane degradation during senescence.
NA	Multilayered Regulation of Membrane-Bound ONAC054 Is Essential for Abscisic Acid-Induced Leaf Senescence in Rice	2021	Plant Cell	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea.	In most plants, abscisic acid (ABA) induces premature leaf senescence; however, the mechanisms of ABA signaling during leaf senescence remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the rice (Oryza sativa) NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2 (NAC) transcription factor ONAC054 plays an important role in ABA-induced leaf senescence. The onac054 knockout mutants maintained green leaves, while ONAC054-overexpressing lines showed early leaf yellowing under dark- and ABA-induced senescence conditions. Genome-wide microarray analysis showed that ABA signaling-associated genes, including ABA INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) and senescence-associated genes, including STAY-GREEN and NON-YELLOW COLORING1 (NYC1), were significantly down-regulated in onac054 mutants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and protoplast transient assays showed that ONAC054 directly activates OsABI5 and NYC1 by binding to the mitochondrial dysfunction motif in their promoters. ONAC054 activity is regulated by proteolytic processing of the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD). We found that nuclear import of ONAC054 requires cleavage of the putative C-terminal TMD. Furthermore, the ONAC054 transcript (termed ONAC054¦Á) has an alternatively spliced form (ONAC054¦Â), with seven nucleotides inserted between intron 5 and exon 6, truncating ONAC054¦Á protein at a premature stop codon. ONAC054¦Â lacks the TMD and thus localizes to the nucleus. These findings demonstrate that the activity of ONAC054, which is important for ABA-induced leaf senescence in rice, is precisely controlled by multilayered regulatory processes.
