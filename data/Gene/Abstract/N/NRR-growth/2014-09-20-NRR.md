## Key message
1. __root__, [A novel rice gene, NRR responds to macronutrient deficiency and regulates root growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel rice gene, NRR responds to macronutrient deficiency and regulates root growth%5BTitle%5D)),  We report here the expression and biological functions of a previously uncharacterized rice gene that we have named NRR (nutrition response and root growth), Expression of NRR in rice seedling roots was significantly influenced by deficiency of macronutrients, Knock-down of expression of NRRa or NRRb by RNA interference resulted in enhanced rice root growth, By contrast, overexpression of NRRa in rice exhibited significantly retarded root growth, These results revealed that both NRRa and NRRb played negative regulatory roles in rice root growth, Our findings suggest that NRRa and NRRb, acting as the key components, modulate the rice root architecture with the availability of macronutrients,A novel rice gene, NRR responds to macronutrient deficiency and regulates root growth
