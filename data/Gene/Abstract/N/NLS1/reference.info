In this study, we characterized the semi-dominant mutant nls1-1D (necrotic leaf sheath 1) of rice, which displays spontaneous lesions, specifically on leaf sheaths, with a developmental pattern. nls1-1D plants also exhibited constitutively activated defense responses, including extensive cell death, excess hydrogen peroxide and salicylic acid (SA) accumulation, up-regulated expressions of pathogenesis-related genes, and enhanced resistance to bacterial pathogens. Map-based cloning revealed that NLS1 encodes a typical CC-NB-LRR-type protein in rice. The nls1-1D mutation causes a S367N substitution in the non-conserved region close to the GLPL motif of the NB domain. An adjacent S366T substitution was found in another semi-dominant mutant, nls1-2D, which exhibited the same phenotypes as nls1-1D. Combined analyses of wild-type plants transformed with the mutant NLS1 gene (nls1-1D), NLS1 RNAi and over-expression transgenic lines showed that nls1-2D is allelic to nls1-1D, and both mutations may cause constitutive auto-activation of the NLS1 R protein. Further real-time PCR analysis revealed that NLS1 is expressed constitutively in an age-dependent manner. In addition, because the morphology and constitutive defense responses of nls1-1D were not suppressed by blocking SA or NPR1 transcript accumulation, we suggest that NLS1 mediates both SA and NPR1-independent defense signaling pathways in rice.
