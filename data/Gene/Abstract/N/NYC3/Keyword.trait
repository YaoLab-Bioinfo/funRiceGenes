NYC3|OsNYC3	leaf	Defect in non-yellow coloring 3, an alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family protein, causes a stay-green phenotype during leaf senescence in rice	The chlorophyll content of nyc3 sgr double mutants at the late stage of leaf senescence was also similar to that of sgr
NYC3|OsNYC3	senescence	Defect in non-yellow coloring 3, an alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family protein, causes a stay-green phenotype during leaf senescence in rice	nyc3 retained a higher chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b content than the wild-type but showed a decrease in other senescence parameters during dark incubation, suggesting that it is a non-functional stay-green mutant
