"zebra" mutants have alternating green and chlorotic crossbands on leaf blades and are widely distributed in monocotyledonous crops. Most recently, we cloned the first responsible gene from rice, ZEBRA2, which also leads to the phenotype of rice preharvest sprouting. ZEBRA2, a single-copy gene in the rice genome, encodes a carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO), the key enzyme catalyzing the conversion of cis-lycopene to all-trans lycopene. ZEBRA2 shares high identity with known CRTISOs from other species. Expression analysis via both RT-PCR and ZEBRA2-promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) transgenic rice indicates that ZEBRA2 is predominantly expressed in mesophyll cells of mature leaves where active photosynthesis occurs. Consistent with the alteration in agronomic traits, the zebra2 mutant exhibits decreased photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content. Mutation of the ZEBRA2 gene results in the accumulation of all-trans-lycopene precursor, prolycopene (7Z,9Z,7'Z,9'Z tetra cis-lycopene), in dark-grown zebra2 tissues. Light-grown zebra2 mutant exhibits the characteristic "zebra" phenotype and decreased level of lutein, the xanthophyll that is essential for efficient chl triplet quenching. More severe phenotype of the zebra2 mutant under high light intensity indicates that "zebra" phenotype might be caused by photooxidative damages. We conclude that ZEBRA2 is involved in photoprotection in rice.
tpj0054-0177.pdf	Mutations of genes in synthesis of the carotenoid precursors of ABA lead to pre-harvest sprouting and photo-oxidation in rice	2008	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Centre for Plant Gene Research, Beijing 100101, China.	Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) or vivipary in cereals is an important agronomic trait that results in significant economic loss. A considerable number of mutations that cause PHS have been identified in several species. However, relatively few viviparous mutants in rice (Oryza sativa L.) have been reported. To explore the mechanism of PHS in rice, we carried out an extensive genetic screening and identified 12 PHS mutants (phs). Based on their phenotypes, these phs mutants were classified into three groups. Here we characterize in detail one of these groups, which contains mutations in genes encoding major enzymes of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, including phytoene desaturase (OsPDS), zeta-carotene desaturase (OsZDS), carotenoid isomerase (OsCRTISO) and lycopene beta-cyclase (beta-OsLCY), which are essential for the biosynthesis of carotenoid precursors of ABA. As expected, the amount of ABA was reduced in all four phs mutants compared with that in the wild type. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis revealed the occurrence of photoinhibition in the photosystem and decreased capacity for eliminating excess energy by thermal dissipation. The greatly increased activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes, and reduced photosystem (PS) II core proteins CP43, CP47 and D1 in leaves of the Oscrtiso/phs3-1mutant and OsLCY RNAi transgenic rice indicated that photo-oxidative damage occurred in PS II, consistent with the accumulation of ROS in these plants. These results suggest that the impairment of carotenoid biosynthesis causes photo-oxidation and ABA-deficiency phenotypes, of which the latter is a major factor controlling the PHS trait in rice.
NA	Ethylene Responses in Rice Roots and Coleoptiles Are Differentially Regulated by a Carotenoid Isomerase-Mediated Abscisic Acid Pathway.	2015	Plant Cell	State Key Lab of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	Ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) act synergistically or antagonistically to regulate plant growth and development. ABA is derived from the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. Here, we analyzed the interplay among ethylene, carotenoid biogenesis, and ABA in rice (Oryza sativa) using the rice ethylene response mutant mhz5, which displays a reduced ethylene response in roots but an enhanced ethylene response in coleoptiles. We found that MHZ5 encodes a carotenoid isomerase and that the mutation in mhz5 blocks carotenoid biosynthesis, reduces ABA accumulation, and promotes ethylene production in etiolated seedlings. ABA can largely rescue the ethylene response of the mhz5 mutant. Ethylene induces MHZ5 expression, the production of neoxanthin, an ABA biosynthesis precursor, and ABA accumulation in roots. MHZ5 overexpression results in enhanced ethylene sensitivity in roots and reduced ethylene sensitivity in coleoptiles. Mutation or overexpression of MHZ5 also alters the expression of ethylene-responsive genes. Genetic studies revealed that the MHZ5-mediated ABA pathway acts downstream of ethylene signaling to inhibit root growth. The MHZ5-mediated ABA pathway likely acts upstream but negatively regulates ethylene signaling to control coleoptile growth. Our study reveals novel interactions among ethylene, carotenogenesis, and ABA and provides insight into improvements in agronomic traits and adaptive growth through the manipulation of these pathways in rice.
NA	Mutations in the MIT3 gene encoding a caroteniod isomerase lead to increased tiller number in rice.	2017	Plant Sci	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, China.	Carotenoids not only play important roles in light harvesting and photoprotection against excess light, but also serve as precursors for apocaroteniod hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and strigolactones (SLs). Although light- and ABA-associated phenotypes of the carotenoid biosynthesis mutants such as albino, leaf variegation and preharvest sprouting have been studied extensively, the SLs-related branching phenotype is rarely explored. Here we characterized four allelic rice mutants named mit3, which exhibited moderately increased tiller number, semi-dwarfism and leaf variegation. Map-based cloning revealed that MIT3 encodes a carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO), the key enzyme catalyzing the conversion from prolycopene to all-trans-lycopene in carotenoid biosynthesis. Prolycopene was accumulated while all-trans-lycopene was barely detectable in the dark-grown mit3 seedlings. Accordingly, content of lutein and ¦Â-carotene, the two most abundant carotenoids, was significantly reduced. Furthermore, content of epi-5DS, a native SL, was significantly reduced in mit3. Exogenously applied GR24, a synthetic SL, could rescue the tillering phenotype of mit3. Double mutant analysis of mit3 with the SLs biosynthesis mutant d17 revealed that MIT3 controls tiller development upstream of the SLs biosynthesis pathway. Our results reveal that the tillering phenotype of mit3 is due to SL deficiency and directly link carotenoid deficiency with SL-regulated rice tillering.
