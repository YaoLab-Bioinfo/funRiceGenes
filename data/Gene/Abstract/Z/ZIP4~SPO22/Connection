ZEP1	ZIP4|SPO22	ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis	Here, we identify the rice ZIP4 homolog, a member of the ZMM gene group, and explore its relationship with two other characterized ZMM genes, MER3 and ZEP1
ZEP1	ZIP4|SPO22	ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis	Although zep1 alone gives an increased chiasma number, both zip4 zep1 and mer3 zep1 show a much lower chiasma number than the zip4 or mer3 single mutants
ZEP1	ZIP4|SPO22	ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis	These results imply that the normal functions of ZIP4 and MER3 are required for the regulation of COs by ZEP1

MER3|RCK	ZIP4|SPO22	ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis	Immunocytological analyses of wild-type rice reveal that ZIP4 presents as punctuate foci and colocalizes with MER3 in prophase I meiocytes

MER3|RCK	ZIP4|SPO22	ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis	Double-mutant analyses show that zip4 mer3 displays a greater decrease in the mean number of chiasmata than either of the zip4 or mer3 single mutants, suggesting that ZIP4 and MER3 work cooperatively to promote CO formation but their individual contributions are not completely identical in rice

XRCC3	ZIP4|SPO22	XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.	Moreover, abnormal chromosome localization of RAD51C, DMC1, ZEP1, ZIP4, and MER3 was observed in xrcc3
HEIP1|OsAGG1	ZIP4|SPO22	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 HEIP1 interacts directly with ZIP4 and MSH5
HEIP1|OsAGG1	ZIP4|SPO22	HEIP1 regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice.	 In addition, the loading of HEIP1 depends on ZIP4, but not on MER3, MSH4, or MSH5
