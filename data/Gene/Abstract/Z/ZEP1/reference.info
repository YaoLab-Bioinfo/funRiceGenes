cr20117a.pdf	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	2011	Cell Res	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The events occurring at the onset of meiosis have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, OsAM1 was identified in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by map-based cloning. OsAM1, a homolog of Arabidopsis SWI1 and maize AM1, encodes a protein with a coiled-coil domain in its central region. In the Osam1 mutant, pollen mother cells are arrested at leptotene, showing that OsAM1 is required for the leptotene-zygotene transition. Immunocytological analysis revealed that OsAM1 exists as foci in early prophase I meiocytes. Very faint OsREC8 foci persisted in the Osam1 mutant, indicating that OsAM1 is not required for the initial meiotic recruitment of OsREC8. In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes. In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis.
J Cell Sci-2012-Shen-2581-91.pdf	ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis	2012	J Cell Sci	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	In budding yeast, the ZMM complex is closely associated with class I crossovers and synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. However, the relationship between the ZMM genes remains unclear in most higher eukaryotes. Here, we identify the rice ZIP4 homolog, a member of the ZMM gene group, and explore its relationship with two other characterized ZMM genes, MER3 and ZEP1. Our results show that in the rice zip4 mutant, the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced, although synapsis proceeds with only mild defects. Immunocytological analyses of wild-type rice reveal that ZIP4 presents as punctuate foci and colocalizes with MER3 in prophase I meiocytes. Additionally, ZIP4 is essential for the loading of MER3 onto chromosomes, but not vice versa. Double-mutant analyses show that zip4 mer3 displays a greater decrease in the mean number of chiasmata than either of the zip4 or mer3 single mutants, suggesting that ZIP4 and MER3 work cooperatively to promote CO formation but their individual contributions are not completely identical in rice. Although zep1 alone gives an increased chiasma number, both zip4 zep1 and mer3 zep1 show a much lower chiasma number than the zip4 or mer3 single mutants. These results imply that the normal functions of ZIP4 and MER3 are required for the regulation of COs by ZEP1.

Shugoshin is a conserved protein in eukaryotes that protects the centromeric cohesin of sister chromatids from cleavage by separase during meiosis. In this study, we identify the rice (Oryza sativa, 2n=2x=24) homolog of ZmSGO1 in maize (Zea mays), named OsSGO1. During both mitosis and meiosis, OsSGO1 is recruited from nucleoli onto centromeres at the onset of prophase. In the Tos17-insertional Ossgo1-1 mutant, centromeres of sister chromatids separate precociously from each other from metaphase I, which causes unequal chromosome segregation during meiosis II. Moreover, the release of OsSGO1 from nucleoli is completely blocked in Ossgo1-1, which leads to the absence of OsSGO1 in centromeric regions after the onset of mitosis and meiosis. Furthermore, the timely assembly and maintenance of synaptonemal complexes during early prophase I are affected in Ossgo1 mutants. Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1.
j.1365-313X.2012.05025.x.pdf	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	2012	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	COM1/SAE2 is a highly conserved gene from yeast to higher eukaryotes. Its orthologs, known to cooperate with the MRX complex (Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2), are required for meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) ends resection and specific mitotic DSB repair events. Here, the rice (Oryza sativa, 2n = 2x = 24) COM1/SAE2 homolog was identified through positional cloning, termed OsCOM1. Four independent mutants of OsCOM1 were isolated and characterized. In Oscom1 mutants, synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, homologous pairing and recombination were severely inhibited, whereas aberrant non-homologous chromosome entanglements occurred constantly. Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal. Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants. These results provide direct evidence for the functions of OsCOM1 in promoting homologous synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis.
Plant Cell-2010-Wang-tpc.109.070789.pdf	The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice	2010	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	ZEP1, a transverse filament (TF) protein, is the rice (Oryza sativa) homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana ZYP1. In the Tos17-insertional zep1 mutants, homologous chromosomes align along the entire length of the chromosome, but the synaptonemal complex is not assembled in early prophase I. Crossovers are well formed, and 12 bivalents could be detected from diakinesis to metaphase I, which leads to equal chromosomal segregation in anaphase I. Moreover, the number of crossovers has a tendency to be increased compared with that in the wild type. These phenomena are different from the TF mutants identified so far in other organisms. Chiasma terminalization of the bivalent, which occurs frequently in the wild type, seldom occurred in zep1. Transmission electron micrographs and immunodetection using an antibody against ZEP1 showed that ZEP1 is the central element of the synaptonemal complex. Although PAIR2 and MER3 were loaded normally in zep1, their dissociation was delayed severely compared with the wild type. In addition, ZEP1 is reloaded onto chromosomes in early microspores as the chromosome decondense, suggesting that ZEP1 might have other biological functions during this process.
Plant Cell-2013-Miao-tpc.113.113175.pdf	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice	2013	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	In meiosis, homologous recombination entails programmed DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation and synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly coupled with the DSB repair. Although SCs display extensive structural conservation among species, their components identified are poorly conserved at the sequence level. Here, we identified a novel SC component, designated central region component1 (CRC1), in rice (Oryza sativa). CRC1 colocalizes with ZEP1, the rice SC transverse filament protein, to the central region of SCs in a mutually dependent fashion. Consistent with this colocalization, CRC1 interacts with ZEP1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. CRC1 is orthologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae pachytene checkpoint2 (Pch2) and Mus musculus THYROID receptor-interacting protein13 (TRIP13) and may be a conserved SC component. Additionally, we provide evidence that CRC1 is essential for meiotic DSB formation. CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation. PAIR2, the rice ortholog of budding yeast homolog pairing1, is required for homologous chromosome pairing. We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes. The roles of CRC1 identified here have not been reported for Pch2 or TRIP13.
Plant Physiol.-2011-Shao-pp.111.177428.pdf	OsREC8 is essential for chromatid cohesion and metaphase I monopolar orientation in rice meiosis	2011	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	The successful transmission of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis relies on the establishment and subsequent release of cohesion between replicated chromatids. Cohesion is mediated by a four-subunit structural maintenance of chromosome complex, called cohesins. REC8 is a key component of this meiotic cohesion complex in most model organisms studied to date. Here, we isolated and dissected the functions of OsREC8, a rice (Oryza sativa) REC8 homolog, using two null Osrec8 mutants. We showed that OsREC8 encodes a protein that localized to meiotic chromosomes from approximately meiotic interphase to metaphase I. Homologous pairing and telomere bouquet formation were abnormal in Osrec8 meiocytes. Furthermore, fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments on Osrec8 meiocytes demonstrated that the mutation eliminated meiotic centromeric cohesion completely during prophase I and also led to the bipolar orientation of the kinetochores during the first meiotic division and accordingly resulted in premature separation of sister chromatid during meiosis I. Immunolocalization analyses revealed that the loading of PAIR2, PAIR3, OsMER3, and ZEP1 all depended on OsREC8. By contrast, the presence of the OsREC8 signal in pair2, pair3, Osmer3, and zep1 mutants indicated that the loading of OsREC8 did not rely on these four proteins. These results suggest that OsREC8 has several essential roles in the meiotic processes.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs00412-010-0284-7.pdf	OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice	2010	Chromosoma	Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology of Jiangsu Province/Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of Ministry of Education, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, China.	Spo11 is a homolog of a subunit of archaebacterial topoisomerase, which catalyzes DNA double-strand breaks and initiates homologous chromosome recombination. In the present study, we silenced the SPO11-1 gene in rice (Oryza sativa) using RNAi. Rice plants with loss-of-function of OsSPO11-1 have no apparent growth defects during vegetative development, but homologous chromosome pairing and recombination are significantly obstructed. Telomeres can be assembled as bouquet during the zygotene stage of the OsSPO11-1-deficient plants, just as that in wild type. Although the two axial-associated proteins, REC8 and PAIR2, are loaded onto the chromosomes, the depletion of PAIR2 from the chromosomes is much later than in wild type. The central element of the synaptonemal complex (SC), ZEP1, does not load onto the chromosomes normally, implying that SC formation is disturbed severely. The crossover protein, MER3, isn't efficiently assembled onto chromosomes and the lack of bivalent suggests that crossovers are also affected in the absence of OsSPO11-1. Thus, OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosomes pairing and crossover formation during meiosis in rice.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs11103-013-0057-9.pdf	The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages	2013	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Plant Biology, Center for Evolutionary Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, 220 Handan Road, Shanghai 200433, China.	Drought is one of the critical factors limiting reproductive yields of rice and other crops globally. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying reproductive development under drought stress in rice. To explore the potential gene function for improving rice reproductive development under drought, a drought induced gene, Oryza sativa Drought-Induced LTP (OsDIL) encoding a lipid transfer protein, was identified from our microarray data and selected for further study. OsDIL was primarily expressed in the anther and mainly responsive to abiotic stresses, including drought, cold, NaCl, and stress-related plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Compared with wild type, the OsDIL-overexpressing transgenic rice plants were more tolerant to drought stress during vegetative development and showed less severe tapetal defects and fewer defective anther sacs when treated with drought at the reproductive stage. The expression levels of the drought-responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up-regulated in the OsDIL-overexpression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down-regulated. Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought. Overexpression of OsDIL significantly enhanced drought resistance in transgenic rice during reproductive development, while showing no phenotypic changes or yield penalty under normal conditions. Therefore, OsDIL is an excellent candidate gene for genetic improvement of crop yield in adaption to unfavorable environments.
NA	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	2020	Front Plant Sci	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	The mammalian BREAST CANCER 2 (BRCA2) gene is a tumor suppressor that plays a crucial role in DNA repair and homologous recombination (HR). Here, we report the identification and characterization of OsBRCA2, the rice orthologue of human BRCA2. Osbrca2 mutant plants exhibit normal vegetative growth but experience complete male and female sterility as a consequence of severe meiotic defects. Pairing, synapsis and recombination are impaired in osbrca2 male meiocytes, leading to chromosome entanglements and fragmentation. In the absence of OsBRCA2, localization to the meiotic chromosome axes of the strand-invasion proteins OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 is severely reduced and in vitro OsBRCA2 directly interacts with OsRAD51 and OsDMC1. These results indicate that OsBRCA2 is essential for facilitating the loading of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 onto resected ends of programmed double-strand breaks (DSB) during meiosis to promote single-end invasions of homologous chromosomes and accurate recombination. In addition, treatment of osbrca2-1 seedlings with mitomycin C (MMC) led to hypersensitivity. As MMC is a genotoxic agent that creates DNA lesions in the somatic cells that can only be repaired by HR, these results suggest that OsBRCA2 has a conserved role in DSB repair and HR in rice.
