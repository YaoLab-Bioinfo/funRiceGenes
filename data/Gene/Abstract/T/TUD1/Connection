D1|RGA1|LW5	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TUD1 functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice	In this study, we report a D1 genetic interactor Taihu Dwarf1 (TUD1) that encodes a functional U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase
D1|RGA1|LW5	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TUD1 functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice	Genetic, phenotypic, and physiological analyses have shown that tud1 is epistatic to d1 and is less sensitive to BR treatment
D1|RGA1|LW5	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TUD1 functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice	Furthermore, we found that D1 directly interacts with TUD1
D1|RGA1|LW5	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TUD1 functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice	Taken together, these results demonstrate that D1 and TUD1 act together to mediate a BR-signaling pathway
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	Rice ERECT LEAF 1 acts in an alternative brassinosteroid signaling pathway independent of the receptor kinase OsBRI1.	 A double mutant obtained by crossing elf1-1 (a null mutant of ELF1) with d61-1 (a leaky mutant of OsBRI1) showed a more severe phenotype than did the elf1-1 single mutant, resembling that of a severe brassinosteroid-deficient mutant
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	Rice ERECT LEAF 1 acts in an alternative brassinosteroid signaling pathway independent of the receptor kinase OsBRI1.	 These results indicate that less than half of ELF1-regulated genes in rice seedlings are affected by OsBRI1, and suggest that ELF1 acts in a rice brassinosteroid signaling pathway different from that initiated by OsBRI1
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	An E3 ubiquitin ligase, ERECT LEAF1, functions in brassinosteroid signaling of rice.	 Similarities in the phenotypes of elf1 and d61 mutants (mutants of brassinosteroid receptor gene OsBRI1), and in the regulation of ELF1 and OsBRI1 expression, imply that ELF1 functions as a positive regulator of brassinosteroid signaling in rice
OsWRKY4	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.	 Here, by conducting yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro ubiquitination experiments, we demonstrate that ELF1 interacts with the OsWRKY4 transcription factor, a positive regulator of defense responses to rice sheath blight
OsWRKY4	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.	 ELF1 decreased the stability of OsWRKY4, whereas exogenous jasmonic acid treatment suppressed this effect of ELF1, resulting in OsWRKY4 accumulation in rice plants
OsWRKY4	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.	 These results suggest that ELF1 indirectly controls the expression of PR1b and PR5 genes by regulating the OsWRKY4 protein level, and support a hypothesis that brassinosteroid and jasmonic acid cooperate to maintain the balance between growth and defense responses
OsWRKY4	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.	 We conclude that ELF1 participates in the antagonistic interaction between these two phytohormones by suppressing the jasmonic acid response through the down-regulation of OsWRKY4 protein level in rice
TLP|PR5	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.	 These results suggest that ELF1 indirectly controls the expression of PR1b and PR5 genes by regulating the OsWRKY4 protein level, and support a hypothesis that brassinosteroid and jasmonic acid cooperate to maintain the balance between growth and defense responses
