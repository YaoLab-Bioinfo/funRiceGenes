TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	cytokinin	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid
TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	auxin	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	The expression of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was differentially regulated by the plant hormones, auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid
TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2|OsSPO11-2	flower	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	The transcript abundance of OsTOP6A2, OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B was also higher in prepollinated flowers and callus
