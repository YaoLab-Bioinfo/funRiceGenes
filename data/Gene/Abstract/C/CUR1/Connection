CUR1	SaM	CURLED LATER1 encoding the largest subunit of the Elongator complex has a unique role in leaf development and meristem function in rice 	 The shoot apical meristem (SAM) was small and the leaf initiation rate was low, suggesting that the activity of the SAM seemed to be partially reduced in cur1
CUR1	OsELP3	CURLED LATER1 encoding the largest subunit of the Elongator complex has a unique role in leaf development and meristem function in rice	 Furthermore, disruption of OsELP3 encoding the catalytic subunit of Elongator resulted in phenotypes similar to those of cur1 , including the timing of the appearance of mutant phenotypes
