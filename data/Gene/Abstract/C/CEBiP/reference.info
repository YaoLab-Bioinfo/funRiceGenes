Akamatsu-2013-An OsCEBiP_OsCERK1-O.pdf	An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity	2013	Cell Host Microbe	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Nara 630-0192, Japan.	OsCEBiP, a chitin-binding protein, and OsCERK1, a receptor-like kinase, are plasma membrane (PM) proteins that form a receptor complex essential for fungal chitin-driven immune responses in rice. The signaling events immediately following chitin perception are unclear. Investigating the spatiotemporal regulation of the rice small GTPase OsRac1, we find that chitin induces rapid activation of OsRac1 at the PM. Searching for OsRac1 interactors, we identified OsRacGEF1 as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for OsRac1. OsRacGEF1 interacts with OsCERK1 and is activated when its C-terminal S549 is phosphorylated by the cytoplasmic domain of OsCERK1 in response to chitin. Activated OsRacGEF1 is required for chitin-driven immune responses and resistance to rice blast fungus infection. Further, a protein complex including OsCERK1 and OsRacGEF1 is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the PM. Collectively, our results suggest that OsCEBiP, OsCERK1, OsRacGEF1, and OsRac1 function as key components of a "defensome" critically engaged early during chitin-induced immunity.
Kaku-2006-Plant cells recogniz.pdf	Plant cells recognize chitin fragments for defense signaling through a plasma membrane receptor	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Biochemistry, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan. kaku@isc.meiji.ac.jp	Chitin is a major component of fungal cell walls and serves as a molecular pattern for the recognition of potential pathogens in the innate immune systems of both plants and animals. In plants, chitin oligosaccharides have been known to induce various defense responses in a wide range of plant cells including both monocots and dicots. To clarify the molecular machinery involved in the perception and transduction of chitin oligosaccharide elicitor, a high-affinity binding protein for this elicitor was isolated from the plasma membrane of suspension-cultured rice cells. Characterization of the purified protein, CEBiP, as well as the cloning of the corresponding gene revealed that CEBiP is actually a glycoprotein consisting of 328 amino acid residues and glycan chains. CEBiP was predicted to have a short membrane spanning domain at the C terminus. Knockdown of CEBiP gene by RNA interference resulted in the suppression of the elicitor-induced oxidative burst as well as the gene responses, showing that CEBiP plays a key role in the perception and transduction of chitin oligosaccharide elicitor in the rice cells. Structural analysis of CEBiP also indicated the presence of two LysM motifs in the extracellular portion of CEBiP. As the LysM motif has been known to exist in the putative Nod-factor receptor kinases involved in the symbiotic signaling between leguminous plants and rhizobial bacteria, the result indicates the involvement of partially homologous plasma membrane proteins both in defense and symbiotic signaling in plant cells.
Kishimoto-2010-Perception of the ch.pdf	Perception of the chitin oligosaccharides contributes to disease resistance to blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in rice	2010	Plant J	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Chitin is a component of fungal cell walls, and its fragments act as elicitors in many plants. The plasma membrane glycoprotein CEBiP, which possesses LysM domains, is a receptor for the chitin elicitor (CE) in rice. Here, we report that the perception of CE by CEBiP contributes to disease resistance against the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, and that enhanced responses to CE by engineering CEBiP increase disease tolerance. Knockdown of CEBiP expression allowed increased spread of the infection hyphae. To enhance defense responses to CE, we constructed chimeric genes composed of CEBiP and Xa21, which mediate resistance to rice bacterial leaf blight. The expression of either CRXa1 or CRXa3, each of which contains the whole extracellular portion of CEBiP, the whole intracellular domain of XA21, and the transmembrane domain from either CEBiP or XA21, induced cell death accompanied by an increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species after treatment with CE. Rice plants expressing the chimeric receptor exhibited necrotic lesions in response to CE and became more resistant to M. oryzae. Deletion of the first LysM domain in CRXA1 abolished these cellular responses. These results suggest that CEs are produced and recognized through the LysM domain of CEBiP during the interaction between rice and M. oryzae and imply that engineering pattern recognition receptors represents a new strategy for crop protection against fungal diseases.
Liu-2013-OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 pl.pdf	OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction	2013	Plant Signal Behav	State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol and Guangdong Key Laboratory of Plant Resources; School of Life Sciences; Sun Yat-sen University; P.R. China.	Plant innate immunity relies on successful detection of trespassing pathogens through recognizing their microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at the cell surface. We recently reported two rice lysin motif (LysM)-containing proteins, OsLYP4 and OsLYP6, as dual functional PRRs sensing bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and fungal chitin. Here we further demonstrated the important roles of OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 in rice defense signaling, as silencing of either LYP impaired the defense marker gene activation induced by either bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzaecola or fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Moreover, we found that OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 could form homo- and hetero-dimers, and could interact with CEBiP, suggesting an unexpected complexity of chitin perception in rice.
Mentlak-2012-Effector-mediated su.pdf	Effector-mediated suppression of chitin-triggered immunity by magnaporthe oryzae is necessary for rice blast disease	2012	Plant Cell	School of Biosciences, University of Exeter, Geoffrey Pope Building, Exeter EX4 4QD, United Kingdom.	Plants use pattern recognition receptors to defend themselves from microbial pathogens. These receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate signaling pathways that lead to immunity. In rice (Oryza sativa), the chitin elicitor binding protein (CEBiP) recognizes chitin oligosaccharides released from the cell walls of fungal pathogens. Here, we show that the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae overcomes this first line of plant defense by secreting an effector protein, Secreted LysM Protein1 (Slp1), during invasion of new rice cells. We demonstrate that Slp1 accumulates at the interface between the fungal cell wall and the rice plasma membrane, can bind to chitin, and is able to suppress chitin-induced plant immune responses, including generation of reactive oxygen species and plant defense gene expression. Furthermore, we show that Slp1 competes with CEBiP for binding of chitin oligosaccharides. Slp1 is required by M. oryzae for full virulence and exerts a significant effect on tissue invasion and disease lesion expansion. By contrast, gene silencing of CEBiP in rice allows M. oryzae to cause rice blast disease in the absence of Slp1. We propose that Slp1 sequesters chitin oligosaccharides to prevent PAMP-triggered immunity in rice, thereby facilitating rapid spread of the fungus within host tissue.
Miya-2007-CERK1, a LysM recept.pdf	CERK1, a LysM receptor kinase, is essential for chitin elicitor signaling in Arabidopsis	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Life Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Meiji University, 1-1-1 Higashi-Mita, Tama-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 214-8571, Japan.	Chitin is a major component of fungal cell walls and serves as a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) for the detection of various potential pathogens in innate immune systems of both plants and animals. We recently showed that chitin elicitor-binding protein (CEBiP), plasma membrane glycoprotein with LysM motifs, functions as a cell surface receptor for chitin elicitor in rice. The predicted structure of CEBiP does not contain any intracellular domains, suggesting that an additional component(s) is required for signaling through the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. Here, we identified a receptor-like kinase, designated CERK1, which is essential for chitin elicitor signaling in Arabidopsis. The KO mutants for CERK1 completely lost the ability to respond to the chitin elicitor, including MAPK activation, reactive oxygen species generation, and gene expression. Disease resistance of the KO mutant against an incompatible fungus, Alternaria brassicicola, was partly impaired. Complementation with the WT CERK1 gene showed cerk1 mutations were responsible for the mutant phenotypes. CERK1 is a plasma membrane protein containing three LysM motifs in the extracellular domain and an intracellular Ser/Thr kinase domain with autophosphorylation/myelin basic protein kinase activity, suggesting that CERK1 plays a critical role in fungal MAMP perception in plants.
Shimizu-2010-Two LysM receptor mo.pdf	Two LysM receptor molecules, CEBiP and OsCERK1, cooperatively regulate chitin elicitor signaling in rice	2010	Plant J	Department of Life Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.	Chitin is a major molecular pattern for various fungi, and its fragments, chitin oligosaccharides, are known to induce various defense responses in plant cells. A plasma membrane glycoprotein, CEBiP (chitin elicitor binding protein) and a receptor kinase, CERK1 (chitin elicitor receptor kinase) (also known as LysM-RLK1), were identified as critical components for chitin signaling in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. However, it is not known whether each plant species requires both of these two types of molecules for chitin signaling, nor the relationships between these molecules in membrane signaling. We report here that rice cells require a LysM receptor-like kinase, OsCERK1, in addition to CEBiP, for chitin signaling. Knockdown of OsCERK1 resulted in marked suppression of the defense responses induced by chitin oligosaccharides, indicating that OsCERK1 is essential for chitin signaling in rice. The results of a yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that both CEBiP and OsCERK1 have the potential to form hetero- or homo-oligomers. Immunoprecipitation using a membrane preparation from rice cells treated with chitin oligosaccharides suggested the ligand-induced formation of a receptor complex containing both CEBiP and OsCERK1. Blue native PAGE and chemical cross-linking experiments also suggested that a major portion of CEBiP exists as homo-oligomers even in the absence of chitin oligosaccharides.
Shinya-2012-Functional character.pdf	Functional characterization of CEBiP and CERK1 homologs in arabidopsis and rice reveals the presence of different chitin receptor systems in plants	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Life Sciences, School of Agriculture, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 214-8571 Japan.	Chitin is a representative microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) molecule for various fungi and induces immune responses in many plant species. It has been clarified that the chitin signaling in rice requires a receptor kinase OsCERK1 and a receptor-like protein (Os)CEBiP, which specifically binds chitin oligosaccharides. On the other hand, Arabidopsis requires a receptor kinase (At)CERK1 for chitin signaling but it is not clear whether the plant also requires a CEBiP-like molecule for chitin perception/signaling. To clarify the similarity/difference of the chitin receptor in these two model plants, we first characterized CEBiP homologs in Arabidopsis. Only one of three CEBiP homologs, AtCEBiP (LYM2), showed a high-affinity binding for chitin oligosaccharides similar to rice CEBiP. AtCEBiP also represented the major chitin-binding protein in the Arabidopsis membrane. However, the single/triple knockout (KO) mutants of Arabidopsis CEBiP homologs and the overexpressor of AtCEBiP showed chitin-induced defense responses similar to wild-type Arabidopsis, indicating that AtCEBiP is biochemically functional as a chitin-binding protein but does not contribute to signaling. Studies of the chitin binding properties of the ectodomains of At/OsCERK1 and the chimeric receptors consisting of ecto/cytosolic domains of these molecules indicated that AtCERK1 is sufficient for chitin perception by itself.
NA	The bifunctional plant receptor, OsCERK1, regulates both chitin-triggered immunity and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Life Sciences, School of Agriculture, Meiji University, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 214-8571 Japan These authors contributed equally to this work.	Plants are constantly exposed to threats from pathogenic microbes and thus developed an innate immune system to protect themselves. On the other hand, many plants also have the ability to establish endosymbiosis with beneficial microbes such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or rhizobial bacteria, which improves the growth of host plants. How plants evolved these systems managing such opposite plant-microbe interactions is unclear. We show here that knockout (KO) mutants of OsCERK1, a rice receptor kinase essential for chitin signaling, were impaired not only for chitin-triggered defense responses but also for AM symbiosis, indicating the bifunctionality of OsCERK1 in defense and symbiosis. On the other hand, a KO mutant of OsCEBiP, which forms a receptor complex with OsCERK1 and is essential for chitin-triggered immunity, established mycorrhizal symbiosis normally. Therefore, OsCERK1 but not chitin-triggered immunity is required for AM symbiosis. Furthermore, experiments with chimeric receptors showed that the kinase domains of OsCERK1 and homologs from non-leguminous, mycorrhizal plants could trigger nodulation signaling in legume-rhizobium interactions as the kinase domain of Nod factor receptor1 (NFR1), which is essential for triggering the nodulation program in leguminous plants, did. Because leguminous plants are believed to have developed the rhizobial symbiosis on the basis of AM symbiosis, our results suggest that the symbiotic function of ancestral CERK1 in AM symbiosis enabled the molecular evolution to leguminous NFR1 and resulted in the establishment of legume-rhizobia symbiosis. These results also suggest that OsCERK1 and homologs serve as a molecular switch that activates defense or symbiotic responses depending on the infecting microbes.
NA	Molecular Mechanism for Fungal Cell Wall Recognition by Rice Chitin Receptor OsCEBiP.	2016	Structure	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Protein Science, Center for Structural Biology, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua-Peking Joint Center for Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.	Chitin is the major component of fungal cell wall and serves as a molecular pattern that can be recognized by the receptor OsCEBiP in rice, a lysine motif (LysM) receptor-like protein (RLP), to trigger immune responses. The molecular mechanisms underlying chitin recognition remain elusive. Here we report the crystal structures of the ectodomain of OsCEBiP (OsCEBiP-ECD) in free and chitin-bound forms. The structures reveal that OsCEBiP-ECD contains three tandem LysMs followed by a novel structure fold of cysteine-rich domain. The structures showed that chitin binding induces no striking conformational changes in OsCEBiP. Structural comparison among N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) oligomer-bound LysMs revealed a highly conserved recognition mechanism, which is expected to facilitate study of other LysM-containing proteins for their NAG binding. Modeling study showed that chitin induces OsCEBiP homodimerization in a &quot;sliding mode&quot;. Our data provide insights into rice chitin receptor-mediated immunity triggered by fungal cell wall.
NA	Integrated Metabarcoding and Culturomic-Based Microbiome Profiling of Rice Phyllosphere Reveal Diverse and Functional Bacterial Communities for Blast Disease Suppression.	2021	Front Microbiol	Division of Plant Pathology, ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, India.	Phyllosphere-the harsh foliar plant part exposed to vagaries of environmental and climatic variables is a unique habitat for microbial communities. In the present work, we profiled the phyllosphere microbiome of the rice plants using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (hereafter termed metabarcoding) and the conventional microbiological methods (culturomics) to decipher the microbiome assemblage, composition, and their functions such as antibiosis and defense induction against rice blast disease. The blast susceptible rice genotype (PRR78) harbored far more diverse bacterial species (294 species) than the resistant genotype (Pusa1602) that showed 193 species. Our metabarcoding of bacterial communities in phyllomicrobiome revealed the predominance of the phylum, Proteobacteria, and its members Pantoea, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Erwinia on the phyllosphere of both rice genotypes. The microbiological culturomic validation of metabarcoding-taxonomic annotation further confirmed the prevalence of 31 bacterial isolates representing 11 genera and 16 species with the maximum abundance of Pantoea. The phyllomicrobiome-associated bacterial members displayed antifungal activity on rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, by volatile and non-volatile metabolites. Upon phyllobacterization of rice cultivar PB1, the bacterial species such as Enterobacter sacchari, Microbacterium testaceum, Pantoea ananatis, Pantoea dispersa, Pantoea vagans, Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, Rhizobium sp., and Sphingomonas sp. elicited a defense response and contributed to the suppression of blast disease. qRT-PCR-based gene expression analysis indicated over expression of defense-associated genes such as OsCEBiP, OsCERK1, and phytohormone-associated genes such as OsPAD4, OsEDS1, OsPR1.1, OsNPR1, OsPDF2.2, and OsFMO in phyllobacterized rice seedlings. The phyllosphere bacterial species showing blast suppressive activity on rice were found non-plant pathogenic in tobacco infiltration assay. Our comparative microbiome interrogation of the rice phyllosphere culminated in the isolation and identification of agriculturally significant bacterial communities for blast disease management in rice farming through phyllomicrobiome engineering in the future.
