CDKB1;1|CDKB1	root apical meristem	Isolation and characterization of a rice cDNA encoding B1-type cyclin-dependent kinase	In plants, the CDKB1;1 transcripts were highly expressed in the shoot and root apical meristems, but not in mature plant organs
CDKB1;1|CDKB1	root	Isolation and characterization of a rice cDNA encoding B1-type cyclin-dependent kinase	In plants, the CDKB1;1 transcripts were highly expressed in the shoot and root apical meristems, but not in mature plant organs
CDKB1;1|CDKB1	shoot	Isolation and characterization of a rice cDNA encoding B1-type cyclin-dependent kinase	In plants, the CDKB1;1 transcripts were highly expressed in the shoot and root apical meristems, but not in mature plant organs
CDKB1;1|CDKB1	meristem	Isolation and characterization of a rice cDNA encoding B1-type cyclin-dependent kinase	In plants, the CDKB1;1 transcripts were highly expressed in the shoot and root apical meristems, but not in mature plant organs
CDKB1;1|CDKB1	stomatal	A2-type Cyclin is required for the Asymmetric Entry Division in Rice Stomatal Development.	 In Arabidopsis, four A2-type cyclins (CYCA2s) function redundantly in regulating CDKB1 activity to promote the asymmetric division for stomatal initiation and the symmetric division of guard mother cells (GMCs)
CDKB1;1|CDKB1	stomatal	A2-type Cyclin is required for the Asymmetric Entry Division in Rice Stomatal Development.	 Cross-species complementation tests demonstrated that OsCYCA2;1 and OsCDKB1;1 could complement the defective stomatal phenotypes of Arabidopsis cyca2 and cdkb1 mutants, but also could suppress DNA endoduplication and cell enlargement
