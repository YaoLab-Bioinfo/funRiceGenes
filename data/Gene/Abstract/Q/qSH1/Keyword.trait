qSH1|RIL1	shattering	Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication	Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp
qSH1|RIL1	shattering	An SNP caused loss of seed shattering during rice domestication	We revealed that the qSH1 gene, a major quantitative trait locus of seed shattering in rice, encodes a BEL1-type homeobox gene and demonstrated that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5' regulatory region of the qSH1 gene caused loss of seed shattering owing to the absence of abscission layer formation
