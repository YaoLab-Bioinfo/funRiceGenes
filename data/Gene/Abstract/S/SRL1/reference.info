Leaf rolling is an important agronomic trait in rice (Oryza sativa) breeding and moderate leaf rolling maintains the erectness of leaves and minimizes shadowing between leaves, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and grain yields. Although a few rolled-leaf mutants have been identified and some genes controlling leaf rolling have been isolated, the molecular mechanisms of leaf rolling still need to be elucidated. Here we report the isolation and characterization of SEMI-ROLLED LEAF1 (SRL1), a gene involved in the regulation of leaf rolling. Mutants srl1-1 (point mutation) and srl1-2 (transferred DNA insertion) exhibit adaxially rolled leaves due to the increased numbers of bulliform cells at the adaxial cell layers, which could be rescued by complementary expression of SRL1. SRL1 is expressed in various tissues and is expressed at low levels in bulliform cells. SRL1 protein is located at the plasma membrane and predicted to be a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. Moreover, analysis of the gene expression profile of cells that will become epidermal cells in wild type but probably bulliform cells in srl1-1 by laser-captured microdissection revealed that the expression of genes encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (subunits A, B, C, and D) and H(+)-pyrophosphatase, which are increased during the formation of bulliform cells, were up-regulated in srl1-1. These results provide the transcript profile of rice leaf cells that will become bulliform cells and demonstrate that SRL1 regulates leaf rolling through inhibiting the formation of bulliform cells by negatively regulating the expression of genes encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunits and H(+)-pyrophosphatase, which will help to understand the mechanism regulating leaf rolling.
NA	CLD1/SRL1 modulates leaf rolling by affecting cell wall formation, epidermis integrity and water homeostasis in rice.	2017	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Areas, College of Life Sciences, Northwest A F University, Yangling, 712100, Shaanxi, China.	Leaf rolling is considered as one of the most important agronomic traits in rice breeding. It has been previously reported that SEMI-ROLLED LEAF1 (SRL1) modulates leaf rolling by regulating the formation of bulliform cells in rice. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying SRL1 has yet to be further elucidated. Here, we report the functional characterization of a novel leaf rolling mutant, curled leaf and dwarf 1 (cld1), with multiple morphological defects. Map-based cloning revealed that CLD1 is allelic with SRL1 and loss its function in cld1 through DNA methylation. CLD1/SRL1 encodes a GPI-anchored membrane protein that modulates leaf rolling and other aspects of rice growth and development. The cld1 mutant exhibits significant decreases in cellulose and lignin contents in secondary cell walls of leaves, indicating that loss-of-function of CLD1/SRL1 affects cell wall formation. Furthermore, loss of CLD1/SRL1 function leads to defective leaf epidermis such as bulliform-like epidermal cells. The defects in leaf epidermis decrease the water-retaining capacity and lead to water deficits in cld1 leaves, which contribute to the main cause of leaf rolling. Due to the more rapid water loss and lower water content in leaves, cld1 exhibits reduced drought tolerance. Accordingly, loss of CLD1/SRL1 function causes abnormal expression of genes and proteins associated with cell wall formation, cuticle development and water stress. Taken together, these findings suggest that the functional roles of CLD1/SRL1 in leaf rolling regulation are closely related to the maintenance of cell wall formation, epidermal integrity and water homeostasis.

NA	Improving Rice Leaf Shape Using CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing of SRL1 and Characterizing Its Regulatory Network Involved in Leaf Rolling through Transcriptome Analysis.	2023	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, College of Agriculture, Guangxi University, Nanning 530004, China.	Leaf rolling is a crucial agronomic trait to consider in rice (Oryza sativa L.) breeding as it keeps the leaves upright, reducing interleaf shading and improving photosynthetic efficiency. The SEMI-ROLLED LEAF 1 (SRL1) gene plays a key role in regulating leaf rolling, as it encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein located on the plasma membrane. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to target the second and third exons of the SRL1 gene in the indica rice line GXU103, which resulted in the generation of 14 T(0) transgenic plants with a double-target mutation rate of 21.4%. After screening 120 T(1) generation plants, we identified 26 T-DNA-free homozygous double-target mutation plants. We designated the resulting SRL1 homozygous double-target knockout as srl1-103. This line exhibited defects in leaf development, leaf rolling in the mature upright leaves, and a compact nature of the fully grown plants. Compared with the wild type (WT), the T(2) generation of srl1-103 varied in two key aspects: the width of flag leaf (12.6% reduction compared with WT) and the leaf rolling index (48.77% increase compared with WT). In order to gain a deeper understanding of the involvement of SRL1 in the regulatory network associated with rice leaf development, we performed a transcriptome analysis for the T(2) generation of srl1-103. A comparison of srl1-103 with WT revealed 459 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 388 upregulated genes and 71 downregulated genes. In terms of the function of the DEGs, there seemed to be a significant enrichment of genes associated with cell wall synthesis (LOC_Os08g01670, LOC_Os05g46510, LOC_Os04g51450, LOC_Os10g28080, LOC_Os04g39814, LOC_Os01g71474, LOC_Os01g71350, and LOC_Os11g47600) and vacuole-related genes (LOC_Os09g23300), which may partially explain the increased leaf rolling in srl1-103. Furthermore, the significant downregulation of BAHD acyltransferase-like protein gene (LOC_Os08g44840) could be the main reason for the decreased leaf angle and the compact nature of the mutant plants. In summary, this study successfully elucidated the gene regulatory network in which SRL1 participates, providing theoretical support for targeting this gene in rice breeding programs to promote variety improvement.
