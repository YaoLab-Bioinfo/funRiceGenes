sh4|SHA1	SHAT1	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	Genetic analyses revealed that the expression of SHAT1 in AZ was positively regulated by the trihelix transcription factor SH4
sh4|SHA1	SHAT1	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	Our results suggest a genetic model in which the persistent and concentrated expression of active SHAT1 and SH4 in the AZ during early spikelet developmental stages is required for conferring AZ identification
sh4|SHA1	SHAT1	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	qSH1 functioned downstream of SHAT1 and SH4, through maintaining SHAT1 and SH4 expression in AZ, thus promoting AZ differentiation
SH5|RI	SHAT1	The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis	We also determined that two shattering-related genes, SHAT1 and Sh4, which are necessary for proper formation of an AZ, were induced by SH5.
