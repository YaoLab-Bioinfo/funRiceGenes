OsSGRL	SGR|OsSGR	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice	An SGR homologue, SGR-like (SGRL), has been detected in many plant species
OsSGRL	SGR|OsSGR	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice	As the light intensity increases during the natural photoperiod, the intensity of SGRL expression declines while that of SGR expression increases
OsSGRL	SGR|OsSGR	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice	The relationship between SGRL and SGR and their effects on the degradation of the light-harvesting Chl a/b-binding protein are also discussed
