OsSGRL	SGR	The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice	 An SGR homologue, SGR-like (SGRL), has been detected in many plant species| We show that SGRL is primarily expressed in green tissues, and is significantly downregulated in rice leaves undergoing natural and dark-induced senescence| As the light intensity increases during the natural photoperiod, the intensity of SGRL expression declines while that of SGR expression increases| Overexpression of SGRL reduces the levels of Chl and Chl-binding proteins in leaves, and accelerates their degradation in dark-induced senescence leaves in rice| Our results suggest that the SGRL protein is also involved in Chl degradation| The relationship between SGRL and SGR and their effects on the degradation of the light-harvesting Chl a/b-binding protein are also discussed|The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice
