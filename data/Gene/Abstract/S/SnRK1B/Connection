SnRK1A|OsSnRK1a	SnRK1B|OsK4	The SnRK1A protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice	Two mutants of SnRK1s, snrk1a and snrk1b, were obtained, and the functions of both SnRK1s were further studied
Ehd1	SnRK1B|OsK4	The Oryza sativa Regulator HDR1 Associates with the Kinase OsK4 to Control Photoperiodic Flowering.	OsK4 acts similarly to HDR1, suppressing flowering by upregulating Hd1 and downregulating Ehd1 under LDs, and OsK4 can phosphorylate HD1 with HDR1 presents
