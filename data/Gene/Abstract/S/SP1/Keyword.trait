SP1|BPB1	nitrate	Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size	Phylogenetic analysis implies that SP1 might be a nitrate transporter
SP1|BPB1	nitrate	Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size	However, neither nitrate transporter activity nor any other compounds transported by known PTR proteins could be detected in either a Xenopus oocyte or yeast system, in our study, suggesting that SP1 may need other component(s) to be able to function as a transporter, or that it transports unknown substrates in the monocotyledonous rice plant
SP1|BPB1	transporter	Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size	Gene cloning and characterization indicate that SP1 encodes a putative transporter that belongs to the peptide transporter (PTR) family
SP1|BPB1	transporter	Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size	Phylogenetic analysis implies that SP1 might be a nitrate transporter
SP1|BPB1	transporter	Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size	However, neither nitrate transporter activity nor any other compounds transported by known PTR proteins could be detected in either a Xenopus oocyte or yeast system, in our study, suggesting that SP1 may need other component(s) to be able to function as a transporter, or that it transports unknown substrates in the monocotyledonous rice plant
SP1|BPB1	panicle	Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size	Here, we report on a novel rice mutant, short panicle1 (sp1), which is defective in rice panicle elongation, and thus leads to the short-panicle phenotype
SP1|BPB1	panicle	Short panicle1 encodes a putative PTR family transporter and determines rice panicle size	The SP1 gene is highly expressed in the phloem of the branches of young panicles, which is consistent with the predicted function of SP1 and the sp1 phenotype
