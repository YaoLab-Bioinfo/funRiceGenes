A critical evolutionary step during rice domestication was the elimination of seed shattering. Wild rice disperses seeds freely at maturity to guarantee the propagation, while cultivated rice retains seeds on the straws to make easy harvest and decrease the loss of production. The molecular basis for this key event during rice domestication remains to be elucidated. Here we show that the seed shattering is controlled by a single dominant gene, Shattering1 (SHA1), encoding a member of the trihelix family of plant-specific transcription factors. SHA1 was mapped to a 5.5 kb genomic fragment, which contains a single open reading frame, using a backcrossed population between cultivated rice Teqing and an introgression line IL105 with the seed shattering habit derived from perennial common wild rice, YJCWR. The predicted amino acid sequence of SHA1 in YJCWR and IL105 is distinguished from that in eight domesticated rice cultivars, including Teqing, by only a single amino acid substitution (K79N) caused by a single nucleotide change (g237t). Further sequence verification on the g237t mutation site revealed that the g237t mutation is present in all the domesticated rice cultivars, including 92 indica and 108 japonica cultivars, but not in any of the 24 wild rice accessions examined. Our results demonstrate that the g237t mutation in SHA1 accounts for the elimination of seed shattering, and that all the domesticated rice cultivars harbor the mutant sha1 gene and therefore have lost the ability to shed their seeds at maturity. In addition, our data support the theory that the non-shattering trait selection during rice domestication occurred prior to the indica-japonica differentiation in rice evolutionary history.
j.1365-294X.2010.04708.x.pdf	Molecular evolution of shattering loci in U.S. weedy rice	2010	Mol Ecol	Biology Department, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, USA.	Cultivated rice fields worldwide are plagued with weedy rice, a conspecific weed of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.). The persistence of weedy rice has been attributed, in part, to its ability to shatter (disperse) seed prior to crop harvesting. In the United States, separately evolved weedy rice groups have been shown to share genomic identity with exotic domesticated cultivars. Here, we investigate the shattering phenotype in a collection of U.S. weedy rice accessions, as well as wild and cultivated relatives. We find that all U.S. weedy rice groups shatter seeds easily, despite multiple origins, and in contrast to a decrease in shattering ability seen in cultivated groups. We assessed allelic identity and diversity at the major shattering locus, sh4, in weedy rice; we find that all cultivated and weedy rice, regardless of population, share similar haplotypes at sh4, and all contain a single derived mutation associated with decreased seed shattering. Our data constitute the strongest evidence to date of an evolution of weeds from domesticated backgrounds. The combination of a shared cultivar sh4 allele and a highly shattering phenotype, suggests that U.S. weedy rice have re-acquired the shattering trait after divergence from their progenitors through alternative genetic mechanisms.

With a small and sequenced genome, rice provides an excellent system for studying the genetics of cereal domestication. We conducted a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of key domestication traits using an F2 population derived from a cross between the cultivated rice, Oryza sativa, and the annual wild species, O. nivara. We found that the QTL of large phenotypic effects were targeted by domestication selection for effective harvest and planting, including a reduction in seed shattering and seed dormancy and the synchronization of seed maturation. Selection for higher yield was probably responsible for the fixation of mutations at a cluster of QTL on chromosome 7 and a few other chromosomal locations that could have substantially improved plant architecture and panicle structure, resulting in fewer erect tillers and longer and more highly branched panicles in cultivated rice. In comparison with the wild perennial species, O. rufipogon, rice domestication from O. nivara would have involved QTL with a greater degree of chromosomal co-localization and required little genetic change associated with life history or mating system transitions. The genetic analyses of domestication traits with both wild relatives will open opportunities for the improvement of rice cultivars utilizing natural germplasm.

Molecular cloning of major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for the reduction of rice grain shattering, a hallmark of cereal domestication, provided opportunities for in-depth investigation of domestication processes. Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp. indica and Oryza sativa ssp. japonica, and the wild progenitors, Oryza nivara andOryza rufipogon. The nonshattering sh4 allele was fixed in all rice cultivars, with levels of sequence polymorphism significantly reduced in both indica and japonica cultivars relative to the wild progenitors. The sh4 phylogeny together with the neutrality tests and coalescent simulations suggested that sh4 had a single origin and was fixed by artificial selection during the domestication of rice. Selection on qSH1 was not detected in indica and remained unclear in japonica. Selection on sh4 could be strong enough to have driven its fixation in a population of cultivated rice within a period of c. 100 yr. The slow fixation of the nonshattering phenotype observed at the archeological sites might be a result of relatively weak selection on mutations other than sh4 in early rice cultivation. The fixation of sh4 could have been achieved later through strong selection for the optimal phenotype.
Plant Cell-2012-Zhou-tpc.111.094383.pdf	Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1	2012	Plant Cell	National Center for Gene Research, National Center for Plant Gene Research Shanghai and Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200233, China.	Seed shattering is an important agricultural trait in crop domestication. SH4 (for grain shattering quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4) and qSH1 (for quantitative trait locus of seed shattering on chromosome 1) genes have been identified as required for reduced seed shattering during rice (Oryza sativa) domestication. However, the regulatory pathways of seed shattering in rice remain unknown. Here, we identified a seed shattering abortion1 (shat1) mutant in a wild rice introgression line. The SHAT1 gene, which encodes an APETALA2 transcription factor, is required for seed shattering through specifying abscission zone (AZ) development in rice. Genetic analyses revealed that the expression of SHAT1 in AZ was positively regulated by the trihelix transcription factor SH4. We also identified a frameshift mutant of SH4 that completely eliminated AZs and showed nonshattering. Our results suggest a genetic model in which the persistent and concentrated expression of active SHAT1 and SH4 in the AZ during early spikelet developmental stages is required for conferring AZ identification. qSH1 functioned downstream of SHAT1 and SH4, through maintaining SHAT1 and SH4 expression in AZ, thus promoting AZ differentiation.
Science-2006-Li-1936-9.pdf	Rice domestication by reducing shattering	2006	Science	Department of Plant Biology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.	Crop domestication frequently began with the selection of plants that did not naturally shed ripe fruits or seeds. The reduction in grain shattering that led to cereal domestication involved genetic loci of large effect. The molecular basis of this key domestication transition, however, remains unknown. Here we show that human selection of an amino acid substitution in the predicted DNA binding domain encoded by a gene of previously unknown function was primarily responsible for the reduction of grain shattering in rice domestication. The substitution undermined the gene function necessary for the normal development of an abscission layer that controls the separation of a grain from the pedicel.
xionglz1999.pdf	Identification of genetic factors controlling domestication-related traits of rice using an F 2 population of a cross between Oryza sativa and O. rufipogon	1999	TAG Theoretical and Applied Genetics	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural 	Domesticated rice differs from the wild progenitor in large arrays of morphological and physiological traits. The present study was conducted to identify the genetic factors controlling the differences between cultivated rice and its wild progenitor, with the intention to assess the genetic basis of the changes associated with the processes of rice domestication. A total of 19 traits, including seven qualitative and 12 quantitative traits, that are related to domestication were scored in an F2 population from a cross between a variety of the Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and an accession of the common wild rice (O. rufipogon). Loci controlling the inheritance of these traits were determined by making use of a molecular linkage map consisting of 348 molecular-marker loci (313 RFLPs, 12 SSRs and 23 AFLPs) based on this F2 population. All seven qualitative traits were each controlled by a single Mendelian locus. Analysis of the 12 quantitative traits resolved a total of 44 putative QTLs with an average of 3.7 QTLs per trait. The amount of variation explained by individual QTLs ranged from a low of 6.9% to a high of 59.8%, and many of the QTLs accounted for more than 20% of the variation. Thus, genes of both major and minor effect were involved in the differences between wild and cultivated rice. The results also showed that most of the genetic factors (qualitative or QTLs) controlling the domestication-related traits were concentrated in a few chromosomal blocks. Such a clustered distribution of the genes may provide explanations for the genetic basis of the â€œdomestication syndromeâ€<U+393C><U+3E64> observed in evolutionary studies and also for the â€œlinkage dragâ€<U+393C><U+3E64> that occurs in many breeding programs. The information on the genetic basis of some desirable traits possessed by the wild parent may also be useful for facilitating the utilization of these traits in rice-breeding programs.
NA	Multiple tissue-specific expression of rice seed-shattering gene SH4 regulated by its promoter pSH4.	2015	Rice (N Y)	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Biodiversity and Ecological Engineering, Institute of Biodiversity Science, Fudan University, Songhu Road 2005, Shanghai, 200436 China.	Rice seed shattering is an important domestication syndrome encoded by a gene named as SH4. The coding region of SH4 has been well studied regarding its function and roles in evolution. However, its promoter has not been identified, which limited our understanding of the detailed regulatory mechanisms of this gene. It is therefore critical to characterize the promoter and study its expression pattern.We analyzed the 5' upstream sequences of this gene and identified a ~2.6 kb fragment with typical promoter features, which was designated as pSH4. The promoter contained a number of cis-acting elements related to abscisic acid (ABA) and a CpG island that were characteristics of multiple tissue-specific expression. We isolated and ligated pSH4 to the Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, and transformed it into a japonica rice cultivar to determine the multiple expression pattern of SH4. Histochemical location and fluorescence analyses of GUS activity of transgenic plants indicated multiple tissue-specific expression of pSH4 in the seed-pedicel junction region of mature panicles (with highest level), stems, coleoptiles of germinated seeds, and scutella of mature seeds.The multiple tissue-specific expression pSH4 is categorized as a spatiotemporal promoter that drives the expression of the SH4 gene in different rice tissues, in addition to the seed-pedicel junction region. Our findings suggest that SH4 may have additional functions in the growth and development of rice, apart from its major role in seed shattering.
NA	A single-nucleotide polymorphism causes smaller grain size and loss of seed shattering during African rice domestication.	2017	Nat Plants	National Centre for Evaluation of Agricultural Wild Plants (Rice), MOE Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Grain size is one of the most important components of grain yield and selecting large seeds has been a main target during plant domestication. Surprisingly, the grain of African cultivated rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.) typically is smaller than that of its progenitor, Oryza barthii. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a quantitative trait locus, GL4, controlling the grain length on chromosome 4 in African rice, which regulates longitudinal cell elongation of the outer and inner glumes. Interestingly, GL4 also controls the seed shattering phenotype like its orthologue SH4 gene in Asian rice. Our data show that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation in the GL4 gene resulted in a premature stop codon and led to small seeds and loss of seed shattering during African rice domestication. These results provide new insights into diverse domestication practices in African rice, and also pave the way for enhancing crop yield to meeting the challenge of cereal demand in West Africa.
NA	Two SNP Mutations Turned off Seed Shattering in Rice.	2019	Plants (Basel)	Yunnan Key Laboratory for Rice Genetic Improvement, Food Crops Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences (YAAS), Kunming 650200, China.	Seed shattering is an important agronomic trait in rice domestication. In this study, using a near-isogenic line (NIL-hs1) from Oryza barthii, we found a hybrid seed shattering phenomenon between the NIL-hs1 and its recurrent parent, a japonica variety Yundao 1. The heterozygotes at hybrid shattering 1 (HS1) exhibited the shattering phenotype, whereas the homozygotes from both parents conferred the non-shattering. The causal HS1 gene for hybrid shattering was located in the region between SSR marker RM17604 and RM8220 on chromosome 4. Sequence verification indicated that HS1 was identical to SH4, and HS1 controlled the hybrid shattering due to harboring the ancestral haplotype, the G allele at G237T site and C allele at C760T site from each parent. Comparative analysis at SH4 showed that all the accessions containing ancestral haplotype, including 78 wild relatives of rice and 8 African cultivated rice, had the shattering phenotype, whereas all the accessions with either of the homozygous domestic haplotypes at one of the two sites, including 17 wild relatives of rice, 111 African cultivated rice and 65 Asian cultivated rice, showed the non-shattering phenotype. Dominant complementation of the G allele at G237T site and the C allele at C760T site in HS1 led to a hybrid shattering phenotype. These results help to shed light on the nature of seed shattering in rice during domestication and improve the moderate shattering varieties adapted to mechanized harvest.
