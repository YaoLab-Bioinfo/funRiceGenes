sh4|SHA1	Multiple tissue-specific expression of rice seed-shattering gene SH4 regulated by its promoter pSH4. |  We isolated and ligated pSH4 to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, and transformed it into a japonica rice cultivar to determine the multiple expression pattern of SH4 |  Histochemical location and fluorescence analyses of GUS activity of transgenic plants indicated multiple tissue-specific expression of pSH4 in the seed-pedicel junction region of mature panicles (with highest level), stems, coleoptiles of germinated seeds, and scutella of mature seeds | The multiple tissue-specific expression pSH4 is categorized as a spatiotemporal promoter that drives the expression of the SH4 gene in different rice tissues, in addition to the seed-pedicel junction region
sh4|SHA1|SG5	 Histochemical observation and gene expression analysis indicated that SG5 regulates spikelet hull development by mediating cell expansion |  Moreover, the expression levels of BG1, GS2, and DEP1 were reduced in sg5 plants, and dual-luciferase (LUC) assays showed that SG5 can bind to the BG1 gene promoter |  The results of our study show that the missense mutation in sg5 is essential for the molecular function of SG5 and SG5 is involved in regulating cell expansion and expression of grain-shape-related genes to regulate grain length
