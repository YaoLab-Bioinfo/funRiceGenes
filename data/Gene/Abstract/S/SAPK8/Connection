OsSAPK8|SAPK8	SAPK9|OsSAPK9	Abscisic acid-activated SNRK2 protein kinases function in the gene-regulation pathway of ABA signal transduction by phosphorylating ABA response element-binding factors	We have shown recently that three members of the rice SnRK2 protein kinase family, SAPK8, SAPK9 and SAPK10, are activated by ABA signal as well as by hyperosmotic stress

OsBIABP1|SLAC1|OsSLAC1	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	Protein kinase OsSAPK8 functions as an essential activator of S-type anion channel OsSLAC1, which is nitrate-selective in rice	Protein kinase OsSAPK8 functions as an essential activator of S-type anion channel OsSLAC1, which is nitrate-selective in rice
OsABIL2	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	Abscisic acid regulates subcellular redistribution of OsABI-LIKE2, a negative regulator in ABA signaling, to control root architecture and drought resistance in Oryza Sativa.	OsABIL2 interacts with OsPYL1, SAPK8 and SAPK10 both in vitro and in vivo, and the phosphatase activity of OsABIL2 was repressed by ABA-bound OsPYL1

CDS1|OsCNGC9	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	 Mechanistically, we showed that in response to chilling stress, OsSAPK8, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana OST1, phosphorylates and activates OsCNGC9 to trigger Ca2+ influx
