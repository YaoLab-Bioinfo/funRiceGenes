SDEL1	Pi	Two RING-finger ubiquitin E3 ligases regulate the degradation of SPX4, the internal phosphate sensor, for phosphate homeostasis and signaling in rice.	 Consistent with this biochemical function of SDEL1 and SDEL2, enhancing the expression of SDEL1 and SDEL2 results in Pi over-accumulation and induces Pi-starvation signaling even under Pi-sufficient conditions
SDEL1	Pi	Two RING-finger ubiquitin E3 ligases regulate the degradation of SPX4, the internal phosphate sensor, for phosphate homeostasis and signaling in rice.	 Therefore SDEL1 and SDEL2 facilitate the degradation of SPX4 to modulate PHR2 activity and regulate Pi-homeostasis and Pi-signaling in response to external Pi availability in rice
