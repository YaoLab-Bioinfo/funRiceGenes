Grain size is a major yield component in rice, and partly controlled by the sizes of the lemma and palea. Molecular mechanisms controlling the sizes of these organs largely remain unknown. In this study, we show that an antagonistic pair of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins is involved in determining rice grain length by controlling cell length in the lemma/palea. Overexpression of an atypical bHLH, named POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1), in lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in transgenic rice. PGL1 is an atypical non-DNA-binding bHLH and assumed to function as an inhibitor of a typical DNA-binding bHLH through heterodimerization. We identified the interaction partner of PGL1 and named it ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG). PGL1 and APG interacted in vivo and localized in the nucleus. As expected, silencing of APG produced the same phenotype as overexpression of PGL1, suggesting antagonistic roles for the two genes. Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants. Observation of the inner epidermal cells of lemma revealed that are caused by increased cell length. PGL1-APG represents a new grain length and weight-controlling pathway in which APG is a negative regulator whose function is inhibited by PGL1.
Plant Cell Physiol-2010-Kitagawa-1315-29.pdf	A novel kinesin 13 protein regulating rice seed length	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Bioscience, Fukui Prefectural University, Yoshida-gun, Fukui, Japan.	The causal gene of a novel small and round seed mutant phenotype (srs3) in rice was identified by map-based cloning and named the SRS3 gene. The SRS3 gene was grouped as a member of the kinesin 13 subfamily. The SRS3 gene codes for a protein of 819 amino acids that contains a kinesin motor domain and a coiled-coil structure. Using scanning electron microscopy, we determined that the cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 is shorter than that in the wild type. The number of cells of seeds in the longitudinal direction in srs3 was not very different from that in the wild type. The result suggests that the small and round seed phenotype of srs3 is due to a reduction in cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction. The SRS3 protein, which is found in the crude microsomal fraction, is highly expressed in developing organs.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs00299-013-1524-0.pdf	Gene SGL, encoding a kinesin-like protein with transactivation activity, is involved in grain length and plant height in rice	2014	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Grain shape, a complex agronomic trait, plays an important role in determining yield and quality in rice. In the present study, a mutant named short grain length (sgl) was identified among explants of tissue cultured japonica variety Kita-ake. It exhibited reduced plant height (about 72 % of WT) and short grain length (about 80 % of WT). The reduced length was due to decreased cell elongation. The Short Grain Length (SGL) gene was isolated via map-based cloning and identified to encode a kinesin-like protein. SGL was expressed in the whole plant, especially in the stem and panicles. SGL was shown to have transcriptional activity. In onion epidermal cells, SGL protein was found mainly in the nucleus. Real-time PCR analyses showed that expression levels of genes involved in gibberellin metabolic pathways were affected in the sgl mutant. These data suggested that SGL protein may be involved in regulating GA synthesis and response genes, that in turn, regulates grain length and plant height.
NA	OsKinesin-13A Is an Active Microtubule Depolymerase Involved in Glume Length Regulation via Affecting Cell Elongation.	2015	Sci Rep	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	Grain size is an important trait influencing both the yield and quality of rice and its major determinant is glume size. However, how glume size is regulated remains largely unknown. Here, we report the characterization of OsKinesin-13A, which regulates cell elongation and glume length in rice. The mutant of OsKinesin-13A, sar1, displayed length reduction in grains and other organs including internodes, leaves and roots. The grain phenotype in sar1 was directly caused by reduction in glume length, which in turn restricted caryopsis size. Histological results revealed that length decrease in sar1 organs resulted from abnormalities in cell elongation. The orientation of cellulose microfibrils was defective in sar1. Consistently, sar1 showed reduced transverse orientation of cortical microtubules. Further observations demonstrated that microtubule turnover was decreased in sar1. OsKinesin-13A was shown to be an active microtubule depolymerase and mainly distributed on vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus and destined for the cell surface. Thus, our results suggest that OsKinesin-13A utilizes its microtubule depolymerization activity to promote microtubule turnover, which may not only influence transverse orientation of cortical microtubules but also facilitate vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, and thus affects cellulose microfibril orientation and cell elongation.
NA	An EMS-induced new sequence variant, TEMS5032, in the coding region of SRS3 gene leads to shorter grain length in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2018	J Appl Genet	National Research Centre on Plant Biotechnology, Pusa Campus, New Delhi, 110 012, India. ukbiotech@gmail.com.	Grain shape and size influence yield and consumer preferences in rice. In the present study, we characterized and mapped a short and bold grained mutant and named it as TEMS5032, as the mutant is a result of EMS-induced transition from C to T at the 5032nd bp of SRS3 gene, which is known to affect grain size in rice. The substitution led to creation of a stop codon in the motor domain of SRS3, a kinesin 13 family gene, translating into a truncated protein product. However, transcription of this gene remained unaffected in TEMS5032 compared to the wild type, N22. Further, the mutation was found to affect 13 of the 25 cell cycle-related genes as they showed differential expression with respect to N22. Based on rate of grain filling, dry matter accumulation in the endosperm and histological studies, the effect of mutation in TEMS5032 was found to be similar to a known variant, TCM758, but less severe than sar1 mutant. Sequencing of 88 rice germplasm lines in the kinesin motor domain region did not reveal the presence of this mutation, establishing it as a new variant of SRS3 gene.
