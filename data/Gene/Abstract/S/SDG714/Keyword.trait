SDG714	culm	SDG714, a histone H3K9 methyltransferase, is involved in Tos17 DNA methylation and transposition in rice	Loss-of-function mutants of SDG714 (SDG714IR transformants) generated by RNA interference display a mostly glabrous phenotype as a result of the lack of macro trichomes in glumes, leaves, and culms compared with control plants
SDG714	growth	SDG714 regulates specific gene expression and consequently affects plant growth via H3K9 dimethylation	Overexpression of YFP-SDG714 in Arabidopsis significantly inhibits plant growth and this inhibition is associated with an enhanced level of H3K9 dimethylation
SDG714	growth	SDG714 regulates specific gene expression and consequently affects plant growth via H3K9 dimethylation	Our microarray results show that many genes essential for the plant growth and development were downregulated in transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing YFP-SDG714
SDG714	growth	SDG714 regulates specific gene expression and consequently affects plant growth via H3K9 dimethylation	Most interestingly, when YFP-SDG714 production is stopped, the inhibited plants can partially restore their growth, suggesting that the perturbation of gene expression caused by YFP-SDG714 is revertible
SDG714	growth	SDG714 regulates specific gene expression and consequently affects plant growth via H3K9 dimethylation	Taken together, our results point to an important role of SDG714 in H3K9 dimethylation, suppression of gene expression and plant growth, and provide a potential method to regulate gene expression and plant development by an on-off switch of SDG714 expression
SDG714	growth	SDG714 regulates specific gene expression and consequently affects plant growth via H3K9 dimethylation	SDG714 regulates specific gene expression and consequently affects plant growth via H3K9 dimethylation
