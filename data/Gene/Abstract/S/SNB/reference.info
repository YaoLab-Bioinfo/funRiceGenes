j.1365-313X.2006.02941.x.pdf	The rice heterochronic gene SUPERNUMERARY BRACT regulates the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem	2007	Plant J	National Research Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics, Division of Molecular and Life Sciences, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea.	Regulating the transition of meristem identity is a critical step in reproductive development. After the shoot apical meristem (SAM) acquires inflorescence meristem identity, it goes through a sequential transition to second- and higher-order meristems that can eventually give rise to floral organs. Despite ample information on the molecular mechanisms that control the transition from SAM to inflorescence meristems, little is known about the mechanism for inflorescence development, especially in monocots. Here, we report the identification of the SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) gene controlling the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem and the floral organ development. This gene encodes a putative transcription factor carrying two AP2 domains. The SNB:GFP fusion protein is localized to the nucleus. SNB is expressed in all the examined tissues, but most strongly in the newly emerging spikelet meristems. In SNB knockout plants, the transition from spikelet meristems to floral meristems is delayed, resulting in the production of multiple rudimentary glumes in an alternative phyllotaxy. The development of additional bracts interferes with subsequent floral architecture. In some spikelets, the empty glumes and lodicules are transformed into lemma/palea-like organs. Occasionally, the number of stamens and carpels is altered and an ectopic floret occurs in the axil of the rachilla. These phenotypes suggest that snb is a heterochronic mutant, affecting the phase transition of spikelet meristems, the pattern formation of floral organs and spikelet meristem determinancy.
j.1365-313X.2011.04804.x.pdf	Two AP2 family genes, supernumerary bract (SNB) and Osindeterminate spikelet 1 (OsIDS1), synergistically control inflorescence architecture and floral meristem establishment in rice	2012	Plant J	Department of Plant Molecular Systems Biotechnology, Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 446-701, Korea.	Meristem identity is crucial in determining the inflorescence architecture of grass species. We previously reported that SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) regulates the transition of spikelet meristems into floral meristems in rice (Oryza sativa). Here we demonstrated that SNB and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE SPIKELET 1 (OsIDS1) together play important roles in inflorescence architecture and the establishment of floral meristems. In snb osids1 double mutants, the numbers of branches and spikelets within a panicle are significantly decreased, and the transition to a floral meristem is further delayed compared with the snb single mutant. Expression analyses showed that SNB and OsIDS1 are required for spatio-temporal expression of B- and E-function floral organ identity genes in the lodicules. In addition, the AP2 family genes are important for determining the degree of ramification in branch meristems, regulating the spatio-temporal expression of spikelet meristem genes, such as FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP). Furthermore, overexpression of microRNA172 (miR172) causes reductions in SNB and OsIDS1 transcript levels, and phenotypes of the transgenic plants are more severe than for snb osids1. This indicates that additional gene(s) participate in the development of branch and floral meristems. Preferential expression of mature miR172s in the area around the spikelet meristems implies that depletion of the AP2 family genes in those meristems via miR172 is an important step in controlling inflorescence branching and the formation of floral organs.
NA	Rice miR172 induces flowering by suppressing OsIDS1 and SNB, two AP2 genes that negatively regulate expression of Ehd1 and florigens.	2014	Rice (N Y)	Crop Biotech Institute &amp; Department of Plant Systems Biotech, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, 446-701, Korea, angdigi@khu.ac.kr.	Rice is a facultative short-day plant that flowers under long days (LD) after a lengthy vegetative phase. Although several inhibitors that delay flowering have been identified, the process by which rice eventually flowers under non-permissive LD conditions is not well understood.Overexpression of miR172 reduced flowering time significantly, suggesting its role as an inducer. Levels of miR172 increased as plants aged, further supporting our findings. Transcripts of SNB and OsIDS1, two members of the AP2 family that have the miR172 target site, were reduced in older plants as the level of miR172 rose. Overexpression of those AP2 genes delayed flowering; overexpression of miR172-resistant forms of SNB or OsIDS1 further delayed this process. This demonstrated that the AP2 genes function downstream of miR172. Two florigen genes -- Hd3a and RFT1 -- and their immediate upstream regulator Ehd1 were suppressed in the AP2 overexpression plants. This suggested that the AP2 genes are upstream repressors of Ehd1. In phytochrome mutants, miR172d levels were increased whereas those of SNB and OsIDS1 were decreased. Thus, it appears that phytochromes inhibit miR172d, an AP2 suppresser.We revealed that miR172d developmentally induced flowering via repressing OsIDS1 and SNB, which suppressed Ehd1. We also showed that phytochromes negatively regulated miR172.
NA	The APETALA2-like transcription factor SUPERNUMERARY BRACT controls rice seed shattering and seed size.	2019	Plant Cell	Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University CITY: Beijing STATE: Beijing China [CN].	The elimination of seed shattering was a crucial event during crop domestication. Improving and fine-tuning the regulation of this process will further enhance grain yield by avoiding seed losses during crop production. In this work, we identified a loss-of-shattering mutant suppression of shattering 1 (ssh1) through a screen of mutagenized wild rice introgression lines with naturally high shattering. Using the MutMap approach and transformation experiments, we isolated a genetic factor for seed shattering, SSH1, which is an allele of SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB), a gene encoding a plant-specific APETALA2-like transcription factor. A C-to-A point mutation in the 9th intron of SNB altered the splicing of its mRNA, causing the reduced shattering of the ssh1 mutant by altering the development of the abscission layer and vascular bundle at the junction between the seed and the pedicel. Our data suggest that SNB positively regulates the expression of two rice REPLUMLESS (RPL) homologs, qSH1 and SH5. In addition, the ssh1 mutant had larger seeds and a higher grain weight, resulting from its increased elongation of the glume longitudinal cells. The further identification of favorable SNB alleles will be valuable for improving rice seed shattering and grain yield using molecular breeding strategies.
