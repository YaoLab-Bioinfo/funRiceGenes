OsBIABP1|SLAC1|OsSLAC1	SLAC7	Loss-of-function mutation of rice SLAC7 decreases chloroplast stability and induces a photoprotection mechanism in rice.	SLAC7 under the control of AtSLAC1 promoter could partially complement the phenotypes of Arabidopsis slac1 mutants, indicating a partial conservation of SLAC protein functions
OsBIABP1|SLAC1|OsSLAC1	OsSAPK8|SAPK8	Protein kinase OsSAPK8 functions as an essential activator of S-type anion channel OsSLAC1, which is nitrate-selective in rice	Protein kinase OsSAPK8 functions as an essential activator of S-type anion channel OsSLAC1, which is nitrate-selective in rice
OsBIABP1|SLAC1|OsSLAC1	OsPP2C53	Two Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice.	 We also characterized the interaction networks between OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53, SAPK10 and OsSLAC1 and found two interaction pathways among those signaling components: a hierarchical interaction pathway that consisted of OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53, SAPK10 and OsSLAC1; and a branched interaction pathway wherein OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 interacted directly with OsSLAC1
