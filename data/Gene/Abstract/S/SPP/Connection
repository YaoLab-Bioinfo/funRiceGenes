FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	SPP	Duplication of an upstream silencer of FZP increases grain yield in rice.	 The CNV-18bp duplication repressed FZP expression, prolonged the panicle branching period and increased grain yield by more than 15% through substantially increasing the number of spikelets per panicle (SPP) and slightly decreasing the 1,000-grain weight (TGW)
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	SPP	Duplication of an upstream silencer of FZP increases grain yield in rice.	 These findings showed that the silencer CNVs coordinate a trade-off between SPP and TGW by fine-tuning FZP expression, and balancing the trade-off could enhance yield potential
OsDER1	SPP	OsDER1 is an ER-associated protein degradation factor that responds to ER stress.	 Furthermore, OsDER1 associated with the signal peptide peptidase (SPP), a homologue of a component of the alternative ERAD pathway recently identified in yeast and mammals
OsGBF1	SPP	Identification of splice variant of OsGBF1 in Oryza sativa ssp. indica genotypes under salinity stress.	 In this study, we analyzed the expression of OsGBF1 during salt stress in two contrasting Oryza sativa spp
