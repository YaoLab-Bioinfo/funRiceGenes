MER3|RCK	SDS|OsSDS	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	The Arabidopsis SDS (SOLO DANCERS) and RCK (ROCK-N-ROLLERS) genes are important for male meiosis, but it is still unknown whether they represent conserved functions in plants
MER3|RCK	SDS|OsSDS	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	We have performed phylogenetic analyses of SDS and RCK and their respective homologs, and identified their putative orthologs in poplar and rice
MER3|RCK	SDS|OsSDS	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
MER3|RCK	SDS|OsSDS	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Further cytological examination of male meiocytes revealed that the SDS deficiency led to defects in homolog interaction and bivalent formation in meiotic prophase I, and RCK deficiency resulted in defective meiotic crossover formation
MER3|RCK	SDS|OsSDS	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	These results indicate that rice SDS and RCK genes have similar functions to their Arabidopsis orthologs
MER3|RCK	SDS|OsSDS	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Because rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, are members of monocots and eudicots, two largest groups of flowering plants, our results suggest that the functions of SDS and RCK are likely conserved in flowering plants
MER3|RCK	SDS|OsSDS	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice
OsPHL3	SDS|OsSDS	Identification of a G2-like transcription factor, OsPHL3, functions as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by co-expression and reverse genetic analysis.	 Further analysis indicated that OsPHL3 delayed flowering time by down-regulating the expression of Hd3a and RFT1 through promoting Hd1 under long-day conditions (LDs), or suppressing Ehd1/Hd1 under short-day conditions (SDs)
