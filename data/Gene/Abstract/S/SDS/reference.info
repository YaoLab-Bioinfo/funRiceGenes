The cyclins together with highly conserved cyclin-dependent kinases regulate cell cycle progression in plants. Although extensive and systematic study on cell cycle mechanisms and cyclin functions in yeasts and animals has been carried out, only a small number of plant cyclins have been characterized and classified functionally and phylogenetically. We identified several types of cyclin genes in the rice genome and characterized them by phylogenetic, tandem and segmental duplications analyses. Our results indicated that there were at least 49 predicted rice cyclin genes in the rice genome, and they were distributed on 12 chromosomes. Of these cyclins, one possessed only cyclin_C domain and no cyclin_N domain, and the remaining 48 cyclins with cyclin_N domains were classified as nine types based on evolutionary relationships. Eight of these nine types were common between rice and Arabidopsis, whereas only one, known as F-type cyclins, was unique to rice. No homologues of the F-type cyclins in plants could be retrieved from the public databases, and reverse transcription-PCR analysis supported an existence of the F-type cyclin genes. Sequence alignment suggested that the cyclin genes in the rice genome experienced a mass of gene tandem and segmental duplications occurred on seven chromosomes related to the origins of new cyclin genes. Our study provided an opportunity to facilitate assessment and classification of new members, serving as a guide for further functional elucidation of rice cyclins.
cr200952a.pdf	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	2009	Cell Res	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.	The Arabidopsis SDS (SOLO DANCERS) and RCK (ROCK-N-ROLLERS) genes are important for male meiosis, but it is still unknown whether they represent conserved functions in plants. We have performed phylogenetic analyses of SDS and RCK and their respective homologs, and identified their putative orthologs in poplar and rice. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens. SDS deficiency also caused a decrease in pollen amounts. Further cytological examination of male meiocytes revealed that the SDS deficiency led to defects in homolog interaction and bivalent formation in meiotic prophase I, and RCK deficiency resulted in defective meiotic crossover formation. These results indicate that rice SDS and RCK genes have similar functions to their Arabidopsis orthologs. Because rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, are members of monocots and eudicots, two largest groups of flowering plants, our results suggest that the functions of SDS and RCK are likely conserved in flowering plants.
NA	OsSDS is essential for DSB formation in rice meiosis.	2015	Front Plant Sci	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Agriculture Biodiversity for Plant Disease Management, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming, China.	SDS is a meiosis specific cyclin-like protein and required for DMC1 mediated double-strand break (DSB) repairing in Arabidopsis. Here, we found its rice homolog, OsSDS, is essential for meiotic DSB formation. The Ossds mutant is normal in vegetative growth but both male and female gametes are inviable. The Ossds meiocytes exhibit severe defects in homologous pairing and synapsis. No γH2AX immunosignals in Ossds meiocytes together with the suppression of chromosome fragmentation in Ossds-1 Osrad51c, both provide strong evidences that OsSDS is essential for meiotic DSB formation. Immunostaining investigations revealed that meiotic chromosome axes are normally formed but both SC installation and localization of recombination elements are failed in Ossds. We suspected that this cyclin protein has been differentiated pretty much between monocots and dicots on its function in meiosis.
