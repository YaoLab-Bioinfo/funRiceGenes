Starch branching enzyme (SBE) catalyzes the cleavage of alpha-1,4-linkages and the subsequent transfer of alpha-1,4 glucan to form an alpha-1,6 branch point in amylopectin. We determined the crystal structure of the rice branching enzyme I (BEI) in complex with maltopentaose at a resolution of 2.2A. Maltopentaose bound to a hydrophobic pocket formed by the N-terminal helix, carbohydrate-binding module 48 (CBM48), and alpha-amylase domain. In addition, glucose moieties could be observed at molecular surfaces on the N-terminal helix (alpha2) and CBM48. Amino acid residues involved in the carbohydrate bindings are highly conserved in other SBEs, suggesting their generally conserved role in substrate binding for SBEs.
10.1360-02tb9074.pdf	Interaction of rice bZIP protein REB with the 5'- upstream re-gion of both rice sbe1 gene and waxy gene	2002	Chinese Science Bulletin	State Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 200032, Shanghai, China	Rice starch branching enzyme 1 (SBE1) and granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) catalyzed the biosynthesis of amylopectin and amylose in rice developing endosperm respectively, and the genes encoding these two enzymes, sbe1 and waxy, are mainly expressed in the endosperm. Within the 5â€‘ù<U+3E32>-upstream region of rice sbe1 gene, we identified a 53 bp fragment C53 which could interact with the nuclear proteins extracted from rice endosperm. We also found that fragment Ha-2 in the 5â€‘ù<U+3E32>-upstream region of rice waxy gene could compete with C53 for its interaction. Further experiments demonstrated that rice bZIP protein REB could interact with two ACGT elements (G-box and Hex) in the fragment C53 as well as three ACGT elements (WG1, WG2, and WG3) in the fragment Ha-2. The WG1 element could compete well with Hex element for its interaction with REB. These results suggested that the expression of sbe1 and waxy gene in rice developing endosperm may be coordinately regulated by REB-like bZIP transcriptional factors.
72_2858.pdf	Biochemical and Crystallographic Characterization of the Starch Branching Enzyme I (BEI) fromOryza sativaL	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Faculty of Agriculture, Graduate School, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.	Starch branching enzyme (SBE) catalyzes the cleavage of alpha-1.4-linkages and the subsequent transfer of alpha-1.4 glucan to form an alpha-1.6 branch point in amylopectin. We overproduced rice branching enzyme I (BEI) in Escherichia coli cells, and the resulting enzyme (rBEI) was characterized with respect to biochemical and crystallographic properties. Specific activities were calculated to be 20.8 units/mg and 2.5 units/mg respectively when amylose and amylopectin were used as substrates. Site-directed mutations of Tyr235, Asp270, His275, Arg342, Asp344, Glu399, and His467 conserved in the alpha-amylase family enzymes drastically reduced catalytic activity of rBEI. This result suggests that the structures of BEI and the other alpha-amylase family enzymes are similar and that they share common catalytic mechanisms. Crystals of rBEI were grown under appropriate conditions and the crystals diffracted to a resolution of 3.0 A on a synchrotron X-ray source.
73_2516.pdf	The Action of Rice Branching Enzyme I (BEI) on Starches	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Faculty of Agriculture, Graduate School, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.	The rice branching enzyme I (BEI) overproduced in Escherichia coli cells was investigated with respect to action on starches. BEI treatment decreased the turbidity of starch suspensions with distinct pasting behaviors from a native starch. This result suggests the great potential of BEI as a molecular tool for the production of a novel glucan polymer.
cDNA+Cloning+and+Sequence+Analysis+of+Rice+Sbe1+and+Sbe3+Genes.pdf	cDNA Cloning and Sequence Analysis of Rice Sbe1 and Sbe3 Genes	2004	RICE SCIENCE	Agricultural College, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China	Two starch-branching enzyme (SBE) in rice, is known to be a key enzyme in amylopectin biosynthesis. The cDNA of two SBE(starch-branching enzyme) genes Sbe1 and Sbe3 encoding SBE I and SBE III (two major isoforms in rice) were cloned by an improved RT-PCR technique, from a template cDNA library derived from the total mRNAs extracted from the immature seeds of a japonica rice Wuyunjing 7. DNA sequence analysis showed that the size of the cloned Sbe1 and Sbe3 cDNAs were 2490 and 2481 bp long, respectively, including their entire coding sequences. Comparison analysis indicated that the nucleotide sequence of Sbe3 was the same as that of sbe3 (Genbank Accession No. D16201) as reported previously. There were only four base-pairs difference, which resulted in changes of two deduced amino acids between the cloned Sbe1 cDNA and the reported sbe1 (Genbank Accession No. D11082). The cloned Sbe1 and Sbe3 cDNAs make it possible to improve rice starch quality through genetic engineering.
ert187.pdf	OsbZIP58, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, regulates starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm	2013	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, PR China.	Starch composition and the amount in endosperm, both of which contribute dramatically to seed yield, cooking quality, and taste in cereals, are determined by a series of complex biochemical reactions. However, the mechanism regulating starch biosynthesis in cereal seeds is not well understood. This study showed that OsbZIP58, a bZIP transcription factor, is a key transcriptional regulator controlling starch synthesis in rice endosperm. OsbZIP58 was expressed mainly in endosperm during active starch synthesis. osbzip58 null mutants displayed abnormal seed morphology with altered starch accumulation in the white belly region and decreased amounts of total starch and amylose. Moreover, osbzip58 had a higher proportion of short chains and a lower proportion of intermediate chains of amylopectin. Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, OsSSIIa, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression. These findings indicate that OsbZIP58 functions as a key regulator of starch synthesis in rice seeds and provide new insights into seed quality control.
NA	Relative importance of branching enzyme isoforms in determining starch fine structure and physicochemical properties of indica rice.	2021	Plant Mol Biol	Key Laboratory of Nuclear Agricultural Sciences of Ministry of Agriculture and Zhejiang Province, Institute of Nuclear Agricultural Sciences, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Zijingang Campus, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Down-regulation of starch branching enzymes alters fine structure and starch properties, especially the B-type crystalline pattern and extremely high amylose content identified in the BEIIb-deficiency mutant in the indica rice. The relative importance of the starch branching enzymes in determining the molecular fine structure and starch functional properties were uncovered in this study. An indica rice, Guangluai 4 with high amylose content (AC) and high gelatinization temperature (GT) was used to generate the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/associated protein-9 (Cas9) knockout lines. Five mutant lines were identified including be1-1, be1-2, be2a-1, be2a-2 and be2b-1, and analysis of western blot showed the CRISPR/Cas9 system was successful in inducing mutations in the targeted genes. AC of be2b-1 (34.1%) was greater than that of wild type (WT) (27.4%) and other mutants. Mutations of either BEI or BEIIa did not alter the starch crystallite pattern (A-type). The BEIIb deficiency caused an opaque endosperm to B-type, and dramatically increased the degree of ordered structure, the relative proportion of amylose chains and intermediate to long amylopectin chains, average chain length of amylopectin molecules as well as GT. The BEIIa deficiency had no effect on the proportion of amylose chains, the length of amylopectin intermediate-long chains, conclusion temperature and enthalpy of gelatinization. Down-regulation of BEI increased the proportion of shortest amylopectin chains (fa) but decreased the proportion of long amylopectin chains (fb2 and fb3), leading to a lower GT. It is concluded that the relative importance in determining starch fine structures and functionality was in the order of BEIIb &gt; BEI &gt; BEIIa. Our results provide new information for utilizations of BE-deficient mutants in rice quality breeding.
