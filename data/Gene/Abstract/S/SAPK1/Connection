The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.
SAPK1|OsSAPK1	SAPK2|OsSAPK2	The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.	 To date, the functions of two rice SnRK2s, osmotic stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 1 (SAPK1) and SAPK2, have been unknown
SAPK1|OsSAPK1	SAPK2|OsSAPK2	The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.	Expression profiling revealed that SAPK1 and SAPK2 expression were strongly induced by drought, NaCl, and PEG treatment, but not by ABA
SAPK1|OsSAPK1	SAPK2|OsSAPK2	The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.	 SAPK2 expression was highest in the leaves, followed by the roots, whereas SAPK1 was highest expressed in roots followed by leaves
SAPK1|OsSAPK1	SAPK2|OsSAPK2	The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.	 Under salt stress, sapk1, sapk2 and, in particular, sapk1/2 mutants, exhibited reduced germination rates, more severe growth inhibition, more distinct chlorosis, reduced chlorophyll contents, and reduced survival rates in comparison with the wild-type plants
SAPK1|OsSAPK1	SAPK2|OsSAPK2	The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.	 These results suggest that SAPK1 and SAPK2 may function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance at the germination and seedling stages
SAPK1|OsSAPK1	SAPK2|OsSAPK2	The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.	 We also found that SAPK1 and SAPK2 affected the osmotic potential following salt stress by promoting the generation of osmotically active metabolites such as proline
SAPK1|OsSAPK1	SAPK2|OsSAPK2	The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.	 SAPK1 and SAPK2 also improved reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification following salt stress by promoting the generation of ROS scavengers such as ascorbic acid, and by increasing the expression levels of proteins such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)
SAPK1|OsSAPK1	SAPK2|OsSAPK2	The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.	 SAPK1 and SAPK2 may function collaboratively in reducing Na+ toxicity by affecting the Na+ distribution between roots and shoots, Na+ exclusion from the cytoplasm, and Na+ sequestration into the vacuoles
SAPK1|OsSAPK1	SAPK2|OsSAPK2	The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.	SAPK1 and SAPK2 may function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance at the germination and seedling stages in rice
SAPK1|OsSAPK1	SAPK2|OsSAPK2	The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.	 SAPK1 and SAPK2 may be useful to improve salt tolerance in crop plants
OsbZIP72|OsABF4	SAPK1|OsSAPK1	The coordination of OsbZIP72 and OsMYBS2 with reverse roles regulates the transcription of OsPsbS1 in rice	 OsbZIP72 can be activated by SAPK1, and acts depending on the abscisic acid (ABA) signalling pathway
