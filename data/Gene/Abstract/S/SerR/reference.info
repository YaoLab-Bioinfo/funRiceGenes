Gogami-2009-Occurrence of D-seri.pdf	Occurrence of D-serine in rice and characterization of rice serine racemase	2009	Phytochemistry	Department of Life Science and Biotechnology, Faculty of Chemistry, Materials, and Bioengineering, Kansai University, 3-3-35 Yamate-Cho, Suita, Osaka-Fu 564-8680, Japan.	Germinated, unpolished rice was found to contain a substantial amount of D-serine, with the ratio of the D-enantiomer to the L-enantiomer being higher for serine than for other amino acids. The relative amount of D-serine (D/(D+L)%) reached approximately 10% six days after germination. A putative serine racemase gene (serr, clone No. 001-110-B03) was found in chromosome 4 of the genomic DNA of Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare. This was expressed as serr in Escherichia coli and its gene product (SerR) was purified to apparent homogeneity. SerR is a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of 34.5kDa, and is highly specific for serine. In addition to a serine racemase reaction, SerR catalyzes D- and L-serine dehydratase reactions, for which the specific activities were determined to be 2.73 and 1.42nkatal/mg, respectively. The optimum temperature and pH were respectively determined for the racemase reaction (35 degrees C and pH9.0) and for the dehydratase reaction (35 degrees C and pH9.5). SerR was inhibited by PLP-enzyme inhibitors. ATP decreased the serine racemase activity of SerR but increased the serine dehydratase activity. Kinetic analysis showed that Mg(2+) increases the catalytic efficiency of the serine racemase activity of SerR and decreases that of the serine dehydratase activity. Fluorescence-quenching analysis of the tryptophan residues in SerR indicated that the structure of SerR is distorted by the addition of Mg(2+), and this structural change probably regulates the two enzymatic activities.
