1-s2.0-S0168945205001202-main.pdf	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	2005	Plant Science	Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China	We report here the characterization of function of a novel gene, OsSIN (Orayza sativa SHORT INTERNODES). OsSIN with no intron, encodes a 106 amino acid polypeptide and has no homology proteins in GenBank. The gene shows predominant expression in shoots and is localized in the nucleus. Constitutive expression of OsSIN resulted in dwarfism and reduced number of inferior spikelets. The functional strength was correlated with the level of transgene expression. Transgenic plants were more insensitive to endogenous gibberellic acid (GA) levels than the wild type. The rice with OsSIN overexpression was less sensitive to GA than the wild type in terms of the second leaf sheath length. Expression of OsGAI at protein level was increased in OsSIN-overexpressed rice compared with the wild type. Our results suggest that OsSIN is a new member in the GA pathway regulating rice stem development.
1-s2.0-S1673852711000312-main.pdf	A rice mutant displaying a heterochronically elongated internode carries a 100 kb deletion	2011	J Genet Genomics	National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki 444-8585, Japan.	We have isolated a recessive rice mutant, designated as indeterminate growth (ing), which displays creeping and apparent heterochronic phenotypes in the vegetative period with lanky and winding culms. Rough mapping and subsequent molecular characterization revealed that the ing mutant carries a large deletion, which corresponds to a 103 kb region in the Nipponbare genome, containing nine annotated genes on chromosome 3. Of these annotated genes, the SLR1 gene encoding a DELLA protein is the only one that is well characterized in its function, and its null mutation, which is caused by a single base deletion in the middle of the intronless SLR1 gene, confers a slender phenotype that bears close resemblance to the ing mutant phenotype. The primary cause of the ing mutant phenotype is the deletion of the SLR1 gene, and the ing mutant appears to be the first characterized mutant having the entire SLR1 sequence deleted. Our results also suggest that the deleted region of 103 kb does not contain an indispensable gene, whose dysfunction must result in a lethal phenotype.

Since the 'green revolution,' sd1 has been extensively used to produce modern semi-dwarf varieties. The extensive use of limited dwarfing sources may, however, cause a bottleneck effect in the genetic background of rice varieties. To circumvent this problem, novel and useful sources of dwarf genes must be identified. In this study, we identified three semi-dominant dwarf mutants. These mutants were categorized as dn-type dwarf mutants according to the elongation pattern of internodes. Gibberellin (GA) response tests showed that the mutants were still responsive to GA, although at a reduced rate. Map-based cloning revealed that the dwarf phenotype in these mutants was caused by gain-of-function mutations in the N-terminal region of SLR1. Degradation of the SLR1 protein in these mutants occurred later than in the wild type. Reduced interaction abilities of the SLR1 protein in these mutants with GID1 were also observed using the yeast two-hybrid system. Crossing experiments indicated that with the use of an appropriate genetic background, the semi-dominant dwarf alleles identified in this study could be used to alleviate the deficiency of dwarfing genes for breeding applications.

The plant hormone gibberellin (GA) is crucial for multiple aspects of plant growth and development. To study the relevant regulatory mechanisms, we isolated a rice mutant earlier flowering1, el1, which is deficient in a casein kinase I that has critical roles in both plants and animals. el1 had an enhanced GA response, consistent with the suppression of EL1 expression by exogenous GA(3). Biochemical characterization showed that EL1 specifically phosphorylates the rice DELLA protein SLR1, proving a direct evidence for SLR1 phosphorylation. Overexpression of SLR1 in wild-type plants caused a severe dwarf phenotype, which was significantly suppressed by EL1 deficiency, indicating the negative effect of SLR1 on GA signalling requires the EL1 function. Further studies showed that the phosphorylation of SLR1 is important for maintaining its activity and stability, and mutation of the candidate phosphorylation site of SLR1 results in the altered GA signalling. This study shows EL1 a novel and key regulator of the GA response and provided important clues on casein kinase I activities in GA signalling and plant development.
2680.pdf	Characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying gibberellin perception complex formation in rice	2010	Plant Cell	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	The DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) is a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling in rice (Oryza sativa), and most of the GA-associated responses are induced upon SLR1 degradation. It is assumed that interaction between GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) and the N-terminal DELLA/TVHYNP motif of SLR1 triggers F-box protein GID2-mediated SLR1 degradation. We identified a semidominant dwarf mutant, Slr1-d4, which contains a mutation in the region encoding the C-terminal GRAS domain of SLR1 (SLR1(G576V)). The GA-dependent degradation of SLR1(G576V) was reduced in Slr1-d4, and compared with SLR1, SLR1(G576V) showed reduced interaction with GID1 and almost none with GID2 when tested in yeast cells. Surface plasmon resonance of GID1-SLR1 and GID1-SLR1(G576V) interactions revealed that the GRAS domain of SLR1 functions to stabilize the GID1-SLR1 interaction by reducing its dissociation rate and that the G576V substitution in SLR1 diminishes this stability. These results suggest that the stable interaction of GID1-SLR1 through the GRAS domain is essential for the recognition of SLR1 by GID2. We propose that when the DELLA/TVHYNP motif of SLR1 binds with GID1, it enables the GRAS domain of SLR1 to interact with GID1 and that the stable GID1-SLR1 complex is efficiently recognized by GID2.
cr200828a.pdf	Gibberellin homeostasis and plant height control by EUI and a role for gibberellin in root gravity responses in rice	2008	Cell Res	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China.	The rice Eui (ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE) gene encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that deactivates bioactive gibberellins (GAs). In this study, we investigated controlled expression of the Eui gene and its role in plant development. We found that Eui was differentially induced by exogenous GAs and that the Eui promoter had the highest activity in the vascular bundles. The eui mutant was defective in starch granule development in root caps and Eui overexpression enhanced starch granule generation and gravity responses, revealing a role for GA in root starch granule development and gravity responses. Experiments using embryoless half-seeds revealed that RAmy1A and GAmyb were highly upregulated in eui aleurone cells in the absence of exogenous GA. In addition, the GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox1 and GA20ox2 were downregulated and GA2ox1 was upregulated in eui seedlings. These results indicate that EUI is involved in GA homeostasis, not only in the internodes at the heading stage, but also in the seedling stage, roots and seeds. Disturbing GA homeostasis affected the expression of the GA signaling genes GID1 (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1), GID2 and SLR1. Transgenic RNA interference of the Eui gene effectively increased plant height and improved heading performance. By contrast, the ectopic expression of Eui under the promoters of the rice GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2 significantly reduced plant height. These results demonstrate that a slight increase in Eui expression could dramatically change rice morphology, indicating the practical application of the Eui gene in rice molecular breeding for a high yield potential.
Fukao-2008-Submergence toleranc.pdf	Submergence tolerance conferred by Sub1A is mediated by SLR1 and SLRL1 restriction of gibberellin responses in rice	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, Center for Plant Cell Biology, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.	Submergence-tolerant rice maintains viability during complete submergence by limiting underwater elongation until floodwaters recede. Acclimation responses to submergence are coordinated by the submergence-inducible Sub1A, which encodes an ethylene-responsive factor-type transcription factor (ERF). Sub1A is limited to tolerant genotypes and sufficient to confer submergence tolerance to intolerant accessions. Here we evaluated the role of Sub1A in the integration of ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellin (GA) signaling during submergence. The submergence-stimulated decrease in ABA content was Sub1A-independent, whereas GA-mediated underwater elongation was significantly restricted by Sub1A. Transgenics that ectopically express Sub1A displayed classical GA-insensitive phenotypes, leading to the hypothesis that Sub1A limits the response to GA. Notably Sub1A increased the accumulation of the GA signaling repressors Slender Rice-1 (SLR1) and SLR1 Like-1 (SLRL1) and concomitantly diminished GA-inducible gene expression under submerged conditions. In the Sub1A overexpression line, SLR1 protein levels declined under prolonged submergence but were accompanied by an increase in accumulation of SLRL1, which lacks the DELLA domain. In the presence of Sub1A, the increase in these GA signaling repressors and decrease in GA responsiveness were stimulated by ethylene, which promotes Sub1A expression. Conversely, ethylene promoted GA responsiveness and shoot elongation in submergence-intolerant lines. Together, these results demonstrate that Sub1A limits ethylene-promoted GA responsiveness during submergence by augmenting accumulation of the GA signaling repressors SLR1 and SLRL1.
Itoh-2005-Overexpression of a.pdf	Overexpression of a GRAS protein lacking the DELLA domain confers altered gibberellin responses in rice	2005	Plant J	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan.	The rice SLR1 (SLENDER RICE 1) gene encodes a DELLA protein that belongs to a subfamily of the GRAS protein superfamily and that functions as a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling. Based on the constitutive GA response phenotype of slr1 mutants, SLR1 has been thought to be the sole DELLA-type protein suppressing GA signals in rice. However, in rice genome databases we identified two sequences homologous to SLR1: SLR1-like1 and -2 (SLRL1 and -2). SLRL1 and SLRL2 contain regions with high similarity to the C-terminal conserved domains in SLR1, but lack the N-terminal conserved region of the DELLA proteins. The expression of SLRL1 was positively regulated by GA at the mRNA level and occurred preferentially in reproductive organs, whereas SLRL2 was moderately expressed in mature leaf organs and was not affected by GA. Transformation of SLRL1 into the slr1 mutant rescued the slender phenotype of this mutant. Moreover, overexpression of SLRL1 in normal rice plants induced a dwarf phenotype with an increased level of OsGA20ox2 gene expression and diminished the GA-induced shoot elongation, suggesting that SLRL1 acts as a repressor of GA signaling. Consistent with the fact that SLRL1 does not have a DELLA domain, which is essential for degradation of DELLA proteins, a level of SLRL1 protein was not degraded by application of gibberellic acid. However, the repressive activity of SLRL1 against GA signaling was much weaker than a truncated SLR1 lacking the DELLA domain. Based on these characteristics of SLRL1, the functional roles of SLRL1 in GA signaling in rice are discussed.
j.1365-313X.2003.01990.x.pdf	GID2, an F-box subunit of the SCF E3 complex, specifically interacts with phosphorylated SLR1 protein and regulates the gibberellin-dependent degradation of SLR1 in rice	2004	The Plant Journal	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) controls growth and development in plants. Previously, we identified a rice F-box protein, gibberellin-insensitive dwarf2 (GID2), which is essential for GA-mediated DELLA protein degradation. In this study, we analyzed the biological and molecular biological properties of GID2. Expression of GID2 preferentially occurred in rice organs actively synthesizing GA. Domain analysis of GID2 revealed that the C-terminal regions were essential for the GID2 function, but not the N-terminal region. Yeast two-hybrid assay and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that GID2 is a component of the SCF complex through an interaction with a rice ASK1 homolog, OsSkp15. Furthermore, an in vitro pull-down assay revealed that GID2 specifically interacted with the phosphorylated Slender Rice 1 (SLR1). Taken these results together, we conclude that the phosphorylated SLR1 is caught by the SCFGID2 complex through an interacting affinity between GID2 and phosphorylated SLR1, triggering the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SLR1.
j.1365-313X.2006.02795.x.pdf	GAMYB controls different sets of genes and is differentially regulated by microRNA in aleurone cells and anthers	2006	Plant J	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Furocho, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	GAMYB is a component of gibberellin (GA) signaling in cereal aleurone cells, and has an important role in flower development. However, it is unclear how GAMYB function is regulated. We examined the involvement of a microRNA, miR159, in the regulation of GAMYB expression in cereal aleurone cells and flower development. In aleurone cells, no miR159 expression was observed with or without GA treatment, suggesting that miR159 is not involved in the regulation of GAMYB and GAMYB-like genes in this tissue. miR159 was expressed in tissues other than aleurone, and miR159 over-expressors showed similar but more severe phenotypes than the gamyb mutant. GAMYB and GAMYB-like genes are co-expressed with miR159 in anthers, and the mRNA levels for GAMYB and GAMYB-like genes are negatively correlated with miR159 levels during anther development. Thus, OsGAMYB and OsGAMYB-like genes are regulated by miR159 in flowers. A microarray analysis revealed that OsGAMYB and its upstream regulator SLR1 are involved in the regulation of almost all GA-mediated gene expression in rice aleurone cells. Moreover, different sets of genes are regulated by GAMYB in aleurone cells and anthers. GAMYB binds directly to promoter regions of its target genes in anthers as well as aleurone cells. Based on these observations, we suggest that the regulation of GAMYB expression and GAMYB function are different in aleurone cells and flowers in rice.
j.1365-313X.2006.02875.x.pdf	The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis	2006	Plant J	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan.	SPINDLY (SPY) encodes an O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase that is considered to be a negative regulator of gibberellin (GA) signaling through an unknown mechanism. To understand the function of SPY in GA signaling in rice, we isolated a rice SPINDLY homolog (OsSPY) and produced knockdown transgenic plants in which OsSPY expression was reduced by introducing its antisense or RNAi construct. In knockdown plants, the enhanced elongation of lower internodes was correlated with decreased levels of OsSPY expression, similar to the spindly phenotype of Arabidopsis spy mutants, suggesting that OsSPY also functions as a negative factor in GA signaling in rice. The suppressive function of OsSPY in GA signaling was supported by the findings that the dwarfism was partially rescued and OsGA20ox2 (GA20 oxidase) expression was reduced in GA-deficient and GA-insensitive mutants by the knockdown of OsSPY function. The suppression of OsSPY function in a GA-insensitive mutant, gid2, also caused an increase in the phosphorylation of a rice DELLA protein, SLR1, but did not change the amount of SLR1. This indicates that the function of OsSPY in GA signaling is not via changes in the amount or stability of SLR1, but probably involves control of the suppressive function of SLR1. In addition to the GA-related phenotypes, OsSPY antisense and RNAi plants showed increased lamina joint bending, which is a brassinosteroid-related phenotype, indicating that OsSPY may play roles both in GA signaling and in the brassinosteroid pathway.
j.1365-313X.2012.05000.x.pdf	The suppressive function of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 is dependent on its transcriptional activation activity	2012	Plant J	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	When the gibberellin (GA) receptor GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID1) binds to GA, GID1 interacts with DELLA proteins, repressors of GA signaling. This interaction inhibits the suppressive function of DELLA protein and thereby activates the GA response. However, how DELLA proteins exert their suppressive function and how GID1s inhibit suppressive function of DELLA proteins is unclear. By yeast one-hybrid experiments and transient expression of the N-terminal region of rice DELLA protein (SLR1) in rice callus, we established that the N-terminal DELLA/TVHYNP motif of SLR1 possesses transactivation activity. When SLR1 proteins with various deletions were over-expressed in rice, the severity of dwarfism correlated with the transactivation activity observed in yeast, indicating that SLR1 suppresses plant growth through transactivation activity. This activity was suppressed by the GA-dependent GID1-SLR1 interaction, which may explain why GA responses are induced in the presence of GA. The C-terminal GRAS domain of SLR1 also exhibits a suppressive function on plant growth, possibly by directly or indirectly interacting with the promoter region of target genes. Our results indicate that the N-terminal region of SLR1 has two roles in GA signaling: interaction with GID1 and transactivation activity.
nature04028.pdf	GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 encodes a soluble receptor for gibberellin	2005	Nature	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that are essential for many developmental processes in plants. It has been postulated that plants have both membrane-bound and soluble GA receptors; however, no GA receptors have yet been identified. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a new GA-insensitive dwarf mutant of rice, gid1. The GID1 gene encodes an unknown protein with similarity to the hormone-sensitive lipases, and we observed preferential localization of a GID1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal in nuclei. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-GID1 had a high affinity only for biologically active GAs, whereas mutated GST-GID1 corresponding to three gid1 alleles had no GA-binding affinity. The dissociation constant for GA4 was estimated to be around 10(-7) M, enough to account for the GA dependency of shoot elongation. Moreover, GID1 bound to SLR1, a rice DELLA protein, in a GA-dependent manner in yeast cells. GID1 overexpression resulted in a GA-hypersensitive phenotype. Together, our results indicate that GID1 is a soluble receptor mediating GA signalling in rice.
PC14010057.pdf	The Gibberellin Signaling Pathway Is Regulated by the Appearance and Disappearance of SLENDER RICE1 in Nuclei	2002	The Plant Cell Online	BioScience Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	The slender rice1 mutant (slr1) shows a constitutive gibberellin (GA) response phenotype. To investigate the mode of action of SLR1, we generated transgenic rice expressing a fusion protein consisting of SLR1 and green fluorescent protein (SLR1-GFP) and analyzed the phenotype of the transformants and the subcellular localization of GFP in vivo. SLR1-GFP worked in nuclei to repress the GA signaling pathway; its overproduction caused a dwarf phenotype. Application of GA(3) to SLR1-GFP overproducers induced GA actions such as shoot elongation, downregulation of GA 20-oxidase expression, and upregulation of SLR1 expression linked with the disappearance of the nuclear SLR1-GFP protein. We also performed domain analyses of SLR1 using transgenic plants overproducing different kinds of truncated SLR1 proteins. The analyses revealed that the SLR1 protein can be divided into four parts: a GA signal perception domain located at the N terminus, a regulatory domain for its repression activity, a dimer formation domain essential for signal perception and repression activity, and a repression domain at the C terminus. We conclude that GA signal transduction is regulated by the appearance or disappearance of the nuclear SLR1 protein, which is controlled by the upstream GA signal.
Plant Cell-2001-Ikeda-999-1010.pdf	slender Rice, a Constitutive Gibberellin Response Mutant, Is Caused by a Null Mutation of the SLR1 Gene, an Ortholog of the Height-Regulating Gene GAI/RGA/RHT/D8	2001	The Plant Cell Online	BioScience Center and Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan	The rice slender mutant (slr1-1) is caused by a single recessive mutation and results in a constitutive gibberellin (GA) response phenotype. The mutant elongates as if saturated with GAs. In this mutant, (1) elongation was unaffected by an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, (2) GA-inducible α-amylase was produced by the aleurone layers without gibberellic acid application, and (3) endogenous GA content was lower than in the wild-type plant. These results indicate that the product of the SLR1 gene is an intermediate of the GA signal transduction pathway. SLR1 maps to OsGAI in rice and has significant homology with height-regulating genes, such as RHT-1Da in wheat, D8 in maize, and GAI and RGA in Arabidopsis. The GAI gene family is likely to encode transcriptional factors belonging to the GRAS gene superfamily. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the slr1-1 mutation is a single basepair deletion of the nuclear localization signal domain, resulting in a frameshift mutation that abolishes protein production. Furthermore, introduction of a 6-kb genomic DNA fragment containing the wild-type SLR1 gene into the slr1-1 mutant restored GA sensitivity to normal. These results indicate that the slr1-1 mutant is caused by a loss-of-function mutation of the SLR1 gene, which is an ortholog of GAI, RGA, RHT, and D8. We also succeeded in producing GA-insensitive dwarf rice by transforming wild-type rice with a modified SLR1 gene construct that has a 17–amino acid deletion affecting the DELLA region. Thus, we demonstrate opposite GA response phenotypes depending on the type of mutations in SLR1.

Plant Cell-2008-Ueguchi-Tanaka-2437-46.pdf	Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant	2008	Plant Cell	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan. makoto@nuagr1.agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp	The rice (Oryza sativa) DELLA protein SLR1 acts as a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling. GA perception by GID1 causes SLR1 protein degradation involving the F-box protein GID2; this triggers GA-associated responses such as shoot elongation and seed germination. In GA-insensitive and GA biosynthesis mutants, SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) accumulates to high levels, and the severity of dwarfism is usually correlated with the level of SLR1 accumulation. An exception is the GA-insensitive F-box mutant gid2, which shows milder dwarfism than mutants such as gid1 and cps even though it accumulates higher levels of SLR1. The level of SLR1 protein in gid2 was decreased by loss of GID1 function or treatment with a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, and dwarfism was enhanced. Conversely, overproduction of GID1 or treatment with GA(3) increased the SLR1 level in gid2 and reduced dwarfism. These results indicate that derepression of SLR1 repressive activity can be accomplished by GA and GID1 alone and does not require F-box (GID2) function. Evidence for GA signaling without GID2 was also provided by the expression behavior of GA-regulated genes such as GA-20oxidase1, GID1, and SLR1 in the gid2 mutant. Based on these observations, we propose a model for the release of GA suppression that does not require DELLA protein degradation.
Plant Cell-2010-Yamamoto-3589-602.pdf	A rice gid1 suppressor mutant reveals that gibberellin is not always required for interaction between its receptor, GID1, and DELLA proteins	2010	Plant Cell	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	To investigate gibberellin (GA) signaling using the rice (Oryza sativa) GA receptor GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) mutant gid1-8, we isolated a suppressor mutant, Suppressor of gid1-1 (Sgd-1). Sgd-1 is an intragenic mutant containing the original gid1-8 mutation (L45F) and an additional amino acid substitution (P99S) in the loop region. GID1(P99S) interacts with the rice DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), even in the absence of GA. Substitution of the 99th Pro with other amino acids revealed that substitution with Ala (P99A) caused the highest level of GA-independent interaction. Physicochemical analysis using surface plasmon resonance revealed that GID1(P99A) has smaller K(a) (association) and K(d) (dissociation) values for GA(4) than does wild-type GID1. This suggests that the GID1(P99A) lid is at least partially closed, resulting in both GA-independent and GA-hypersensitive interactions with SLR1. One of the three Arabidopsis thaliana GID1s, At GID1b, can also interact with DELLA proteins in the absence of GA, so we investigated whether GA-independent interaction of At GID1b depends on a mechanism similar to that of rice GID1(P99A). Substitution of the loop region or a few amino acids of At GID1b with those of At GID1a diminished its GA-independent interaction with GAI while maintaining the GA-dependent interaction. Soybean (Glycine max) and Brassica napus also have GID1s similar to At GID1b, indicating that these unique GID1s occur in various dicots and may have important functions in these plants.
Plant Cell Physiol-2002-Ikeda-974-9.pdf	The slender rice mutant, with constitutively activated gibberellin signal transduction, has enhanced capacity for abscisic acid level	2002	Plant and Cell Physiology	Division of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku N10-W8, Sapporo, 060-0810 Japan	The slender rice (slr1-1) mutant, carrying a lethal and recessive single mutation, has a constitutive gibberellin (GA)-response phenotype and behaves as if it were saturated with GAs [Ikeda et al. (2001) Plant Cell 13, 999]. The SLR1 gene, with sequence homology to members of the plant-specific GRAS gene family, is a mediator of the GA signal transduction process. In the slender rice, GA-inducible a-amylase was produced from the aleurone layer without applying GA. GA-independent alpha-amylase production in the mutant was inhibited by applying abscisic acid (ABA). Shoot elongation in the mutant was also suppressed by ABA, indicating that the slender rice responds normally to ABA. Interestingly, shoot ABA content was 10-fold higher in the mutant than in the wild type, while there was no difference in root ABA content. Expression of the Rab16A gene, which is known to be ABA inducible, was about 10-fold higher in shoots of the mutant than in those of the wild type. These results indicate that constitutive activation of the GA signal transduction pathway by the slr1-1 mutation promotes the endogenous ABA level.
Plant Cell Physiol-2006-Luo-181-91.pdf	EUI1, encoding a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, regulates internode elongation by modulating gibberellin responses in rice	2006	Plant Cell Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, PR China.	Elongation of rice internodes is one of the most important agronomic traits, which determines the plant height and underlies the grain yield. It has been shown that the elongation of internodes is under genetic control, and various factors are implicated in the process. Here, we report a detailed characterization of an elongated uppermost internode1 (eui1) mutant, which has been used in hybrid rice breeding. In the eui1-2 mutant, the cell lengths in the uppermost internodes are significantly longer than that of wild type and thus give rise to the elongated uppermost internode. It was found that the level of active gibberellin was elevated in the mutant, whereas its growth in response to gibberellin is similar to that of the wild type, suggesting that the higher level accumulation of gibberellin in the eui1 mutant causes the abnormal elongation of the uppermost internode. Consistently, the expression levels of several genes which encode gibberellin biosynthesis enzymes were altered. We cloned the EUI1 gene, which encodes a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, by map-based cloning and found that EUI1 was weakly expressed in most tissues, but preferentially in young panicles. To confirm its function, transgenic experiments with different constructs of EUI1 were conducted. Overexpression of EUI1 gave rise to the gibberellin-deficient-like phenotypes, which could be partially reversed by supplementation with gibberellin. Furthermore, apart from the alteration of expression levels of the gibberellin biosynthesis genes, accumulation of SLR1 protein was found in the overexpressing transgenic plants, indicating that the expression level of EUI1 is implicated in both gibberellin-mediated SLR1 destruction and a feedback regulation in gibberellin biosynthesis. Therefore, we proposed that EUI1 plays a negative role in gibberellin-mediated regulation of cell elongation in the uppermost internode of rice.
pp1381982.pdf	Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling	2005	Plant Physiol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan.	Molecular genetic studies of plant dwarf mutants have indicated that gibberellin (GA) and brassinosteroid (BR) are two major factors that determine plant height; dwarf mutants that are caused by other defects are relatively rare, especially in monocot species. Here, we report a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf and gladius leaf 1 (dgl1), which exhibits only minimal response to GA and BR. In addition to the dwarf phenotype, dgl1 produces leaves with abnormally rounded tip regions. Positional cloning of DGL1 revealed that it encodes a 60-kD microtubule-severing katanin-like protein. The protein was found to be important in cell elongation and division, based on the observed cell phenotypes. GA biosynthetic genes are up-regulated in dgl1, but the expression of BR biosynthetic genes is not enhanced. The enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in dgl1 is not caused by inappropriate GA signaling because the expression of these genes was repressed by GA3 treatment, and degradation of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 was triggered by GA3 in this mutant. Instead, aberrant microtubule organization caused by the loss of the microtubule-severing function of DGL1 may result in enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in that enhanced expression was also observed in a BR-deficient mutant with aberrant microtubule organization. These results suggest that the function of DGL1 is important for cell and organ elongation in rice, and aberrant DGL1-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling.
NA	A Gibberellin-Mediated DELLA-NAC Signaling Cascade Regulates Cellulose Synthesis in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Cellulose, which can be converted into numerous industrial products, has important impacts on the global economy. It has long been known that cellulose synthesis in plants is tightly regulated by various phytohormones. However, the underlying mechanism of cellulose synthesis regulation remains elusive. Here, we show that in rice (Oryza sativa), gibberellin (GA) signals promote cellulose synthesis by relieving the interaction between SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), a DELLA repressor of GA signaling, and NACs, the top-layer transcription factors for secondary wall formation. Mutations in GA-related genes and physiological treatments altered the transcription of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE genes (CESAs) and the cellulose level. Multiple experiments demonstrated that transcription factors NAC29/31 and MYB61 are CESA regulators in rice; NAC29/31 directly regulates MYB61, which in turn activates CESA expression. This hierarchical regulation pathway is blocked by SLR1-NAC29/31 interactions. Based on the results of anatomical analysis and GA content examination in developing rice internodes, this signaling cascade was found to be modulated by varied endogenous GA levels and to be required for internode development. Genetic and gene expression analyses were further performed in Arabidopsis thaliana GA-related mutants. Altogether, our findings reveal a conserved mechanism by which GA regulates secondary wall cellulose synthesis in land plants and provide a strategy for manipulating cellulose production and plant growth.
NA	The DELLA protein SLR1 integrates and amplifies salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-dependent innate immunity in rice.	2016	Plant Physiol	Bayer CropScience NV CITY: Ghent POSTAL_CODE: 9052 Belgium [BE] ddevleesschauwer@gmail.com.	Gibberellins are a class of tetracyclic plant hormones that are well known to promote plant growth by inducing the degradation of a class of nuclear growth-repressing proteins, called DELLAs. In recent years, GA and DELLAs are also increasingly implicated in plant responses to pathogen attack although our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is still limited, especially in monocotyledonous crop plants. Aiming to further decipher the molecular underpinnings of GA- and DELLA-modulated plant immunity, we have studied the dynamics and impact of GA and DELLA during infection of the model crop rice with four different pathogens exhibiting distinct lifestyles and infection strategies. Opposite to previous findings in Arabidopsis, our findings reveal a prominent role of the DELLA protein Slender Rice1 (SLR1) in the resistance towards (hemi)biotrophic but not necrotrophic rice pathogens. Moreover, contrary to the differential effect of DELLA on the archetypal defense hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) in Arabidopsis, we demonstrate that the resistance-promoting effect of SLR1 is due at least in part to its ability to boost both SA- and JA-mediated rice defenses. In a reciprocal manner, we found JA and SA treatment to interfere with GA metabolism and stabilize SLR1. Together these findings favor a model whereby SLR1 acts as a positive regulator of hemibiotroph resistance in rice by integrating and amplifying SA- and JA-dependent defense signaling. Our results highlight the differences in hormone defense networking between rice and Arabidopsis and underscore the importance of GA and DELLA in molding disease outcomes.
NA	Silencing OsSLR1 enhances the resistance of rice to the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	DELLA proteins, negative regulators of the gibberellin (GA) pathway, play important roles in plant growth, development and pathogen resistance by regulating multiple phytohormone signals. Yet, whether and how they regulate plant herbivore resistance remains unknown. We found that the expression of the rice DELLA gene OsSLR1 was down-regulated by an infestation of female adults of the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens. On one hand, OsSLR1 positively regulated BPH-induced levels of two mitogen-activated protein kinase and four WRKY transcripts, and of jasmonic acid, ethylene and H2 O2 . On the other hand, silencing OsSLR1 enhanced constitutive levels of defense-related compounds, phenolic acids, lignin and cellulose, as well as the resistance of rice to BPH in the laboratory and in the field. The increased resistance in rice with silencing of OsSLR1 is probably due to impaired JA and ethylene pathways, and, at least in part, to the increased lignin level and mechanical hardness of rice leaf sheaths. Our findings illustrate that OsSLR1, acting as an early negative regulator, plays an important role in regulating the resistance of rice to BPH by activating appropriate defense-related signaling pathways and compounds. Moreover, our data also provide new insights into relationships between plant growth and defense.
NA	Gibberellin antagonizes jasmonate-induced defense against Meloidogyne graminicola in rice.	2018	New Phytol	Department of Molecular Biotechnology, Ghent University, 9000, Ghent, Belgium.	Gibberellin (GA) regulates various plant growth and developmental processes, but its role in pathogen attack, and especially nematode-plant interactions, still remains to be elucidated. An in-depth characterization of the role of GA in nematode infection was conducted using mutant lines of rice, chemical inhibitors, and phytohormone measurements. Our results showed that GA influences rice-Meloidogyne graminicola interactions in a concentration-dependent manner. Foliar spray of plants with a low concentration of gibberellic acid enhanced nematode infection. Biosynthetic and signaling mutants confirmed the importance of gibberellin for rice susceptibility to M.<U+00A0>graminicola infection. Our study also demonstrates that GA signaling suppresses jasmonate (JA)-mediated defense against M.<U+00A0>graminicola, and likewise the JA-induced defense against M.<U+00A0>graminicola requires SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1)-mediated repression of the GA pathway. In contrast to observations from other plant-pathogen interactions, GA plays a dominant role over JA in determining susceptibility to M.<U+00A0>graminicola in rice. This GA-induced nematode susceptibility was largely independent of auxin biosynthesis, but relied on auxin transport. In conclusion, we showed that GA-JA antagonistic crosstalk is at the forefront of the interaction between rice and M.<U+00A0>graminicola, and SLR1 plays a central role in the JA-mediated defense response in rice against this nematode.
NA	Characterization of a new semi-dominant dwarf allele of SLR1 and its potential application in hybrid rice breeding.	2018	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China.	The widespread introduction of semi-dwarf1 (sd1), also known as the &quot;Green Revolution&quot; gene, has dramatically increased rice yield. However, the extensive use of limited sources of dwarf genes may cause 'bottleneck' effects in breeding new rice varieties. Alternative dwarf germplasms are quite urgent for rice breeding. Here, we characterized a new allele of rice Slr1-d mutant, Slr1-d6, which reduced plant height by 37%, a much milder allele for dwarfism. Slr-d6 was still responsive to gibberellin (GA) to a reduced extent. The mutation site in Slr1-d6 was less conserved in the TVHYNP domain, leading to the specific semi-dominant dwarf phenotype. Expression of SLR1 and five key GA biosynthetic genes were disturbed in Slr1-d6 and the interaction between Slr1-d6 and GID1 was decreased. In the genetic background of cultivar 9311 with sd1 eliminated, Slr1-d6 homozygous plants were about 70 cm tall. Moreover, Slr1-d6 heterozygous plants were equivalent in height to the standard sd1 semidwarf 9311, but with a 25% yield increase, showing its potential application in hybrid rice breeding.
NA	SLR1 inhibits MOC1 degradation to coordinate tiller number and plant height in rice.	2019	Nat Commun	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	The breeding of cereals with altered gibberellin (GA) signaling propelled the 'Green Revolution' by generating semidwarf plants with increased tiller number. The mechanism by which GAs promote shoot height has been studied extensively, but it is not known what causes the inverse relationship between plant height and tiller number. Here we show that rice tiller number regulator MONOCULM 1 (MOC1) is protected from degradation by binding to the DELLA protein SLENDER RICE 1 (SLR1). GAs trigger the degradation of SLR1, leading to stem elongation and also to the degradation of MOC1, and hence a decrease in tiller number. This discovery provides a molecular explanation for the coordinated control of plant height and tiller number in rice by GAs, SLR1 and MOC1.
NA	SLENDER RICE1 and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE DOMAIN2 Regulating OsmiR396 Is Involved in Stem Elongation.	2020	Plant Physiol	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Key Laboratory of the Ministry of CITY: Yangzhou STATE: Jiangsu province POSTAL_CODE: 225009 China [CN].	Gibberellins (GAs) play key roles in controlling cell proliferation through the GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1)/DELLA-mediated pathway. However, how DELLA proteins affect downstream pathways is not well understood. Therefore, discovering the signaling events downstream of DELLAs is key to better understanding the roles of GAs in plant development. Here we discovered that miR396 is regulated by SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) in controlling cell proliferation. The positive response of rice (Oryza sativa) GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORs (OsGRFs) to GAs was found to be caused by a negative response of miR396 to GAs. miR396 acts downstream of SLR1 and upstream of GA-induced cell-cycle genes. Rice INDETERMINATE DOMAIN2 (OsIDD2) directly binds the promoter of OsmiR396a and can interact with SLR1 in vivo and in vitro. Rice lines overexpressing miR396a (miR396OE) or OsIDD2 (OsIDD2OE) displayed dwarfism resulting from higher abundance of miR396 RNA. However, the stem elongation of OsIDD2OE plants could be significantly stimulated by applying exogenous GA3, while that of miR396OE plants could not. Rice with OsIDD2 knocked down by RNA interference (OsIDD2RNAi) showed a slr1-like phenotype, in which the expression of miR396 was inhibited while its targets were enhanced. The protein levels of OsIDD2 were unaffected by GA in the wild type and OsIDD2OE plants, implying that OSIDD2 promotes the expression of miR396 and likely requires the coactivator of SLR1. Taken together, these results provided a close link between SLR1/OsIDD2 and GRFs via a negative regulator, miR396, and thus highlighted a molecular mechanism of GA-mediated cell proliferation in rice.
NA	PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE14 and SLENDER RICE1 interaction controls seedling growth under salt stress 	2020	Plant Physiol	Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing China [CN].	Early seedling development and emergence from the soil, which are critical for plant growth and important for crop production, are controlled by internal factors, such as phytohormones, and external factors, such as light and salt. However, little is known about how light and salt signals are integrated with endogenous cues in controlling plant physiological processes. Here, we show that overexpression of rice (Oryza sativa) PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE14 (OsPIL14), or loss of function of the DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), promotes mesocotyl and root growth, specifically in the dark and under salt stress. Furthermore, salt induces OsPIL14 turnover but enhances SLR1 accumulation. OsPIL14 directly binds to the promoter of cell elongation-related genes and regulates their expression. SLR1 physically interacts with OsPIL14 and negatively regulates its function. Our study reveals a mechanism by which the OsPIL14-SLR1 transcriptional module integrates light and gibberellin signals to fine-tune seedling growth under salt stress, enhancing understanding about how crops adapt to saline environments.
