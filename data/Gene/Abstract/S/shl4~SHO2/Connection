OsAGO7|shl4|SHO2	RL9|SLL1|AH2|OsADD1	Isolation and characterization of a rice mutant with narrow and rolled leaves	NAL7 and SLL1 were found to be upregulated, whereas OsAGO7 were downregulated in the nrl1 mutant
OsAGO7|shl4|SHO2	OsCD1|OsCSLD4|NRL1|ND1|sle1|DNL1	Isolation and characterization of a rice mutant with narrow and rolled leaves	NAL7 and SLL1 were found to be upregulated, whereas OsAGO7 were downregulated in the nrl1 mutant
OsAGO7|shl4|SHO2	SHO1|OsDCL4	Shoot organization genes regulate shoot apical meristem organization and the pattern of leaf primordium initiation in rice	The mechanism regulating the pattern of leaf initiation was analyzed by using shoot organization (sho) mutants derived from three loci (SHO1, SHO2, and SHO3)
OsAGO7|shl4|SHO2	SHO1|OsDCL4	The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice	Mutations in rice SHOOTLESS2 (SHL2), SHL4/SHOOT ORGANIZATION2 (SHO2), and SHO1 cause complete deletion or abnormal formation of the SAM
OsAGO7|shl4|SHO2	SHO1|OsDCL4	The small interfering RNA production pathway is required for shoot meristem initiation in rice	Rice SHL2, SHL4/SHO2, and SHO1 encoded orthologues of Arabidopsis RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6, ARGONAUTE (AGO) 7, and DICER-like 4, respectively, whose mutations affect leaf development through the trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) pathway
