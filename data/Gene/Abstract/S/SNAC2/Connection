OsNAC19|SNAC1|OsNAC9	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC5 regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice	Pull-down assays revealed that OsNAC5 interacts with OsNAC5, OsNAC6 and SNAC1
OsLEA3|OsLEA3-1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC5 regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice	By gel mobility shift assay, OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 were shown to bind to the OsLEA3 promoter
OsLEA3|OsLEA3-1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC5 regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice	Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different

OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	Interestingly, OsNAC6, a member of the NAM-ATAF-CUC (NAC) family, was identified as a key component of the OsHDAC1 regulon, and was found to be epigenetically repressed by OsHDAC1 overexpression
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	The root phenotype of OsNAC6 knock-out seedlings was observed to be similar to that of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	Conversely, the root phenotype of the OsNAC6 overexpressors was similar to that of the OsHDAC1 knock-out seedlings
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	These observations indicate that OsHDAC1 negatively regulates the OsNAC6 gene that primarily mediates the alteration in the root growth of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the OsNAC6 promoter region using antibodies specific to acetylated histones H3 and H4 revealed that OsHDAC1 epigenetically represses the expression of OsNAC6 by deacetylating K9, K14 and K18 on H3 and K5, K12 and K16 on H4

OsNAC6|SNAC2	OsTZF5	Expression of the CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein gene OsTZF5 under a stress-inducible promoter mitigates the effect of drought stress on rice grain yield under field conditions.	 By introducing OsTZF5 behind the stress-responsive OsNAC6 promoter in two commercial upland cultivars, Curinga and NERICA4, we obtained transgenic plants that showed no growth retardation
