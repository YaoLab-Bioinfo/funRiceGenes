YGL8|YL2	leaf	Map-based cloning and functional analysis of YGL8, which controls leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).	Map-based cloning results showed that Loc_Os01g73450, encoding a chloroplast-targeted UMP kinase, corresponded to Ygl8 and played an important role in regulating leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa)
YGL8|YL2	leaf	Map-based cloning and functional analysis of YGL8, which controls leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).	Analysis of the spatial and temporal expression of Ygl8 indicated that it was highly expressed in leaf blades and weakly expressed in other tissues
YGL8|YL2	growth	Map-based cloning and functional analysis of YGL8, which controls leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).	The levels of Chl a, Chl b and total chlorophyll were significantly lower in ygl8 than those in the WT throughout the whole growth period, while no clear change was noted in the Chl a/b ratio
YGL8|YL2	map-based cloning	Map-based cloning and functional analysis of YGL8, which controls leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).	Map-based cloning results showed that Loc_Os01g73450, encoding a chloroplast-targeted UMP kinase, corresponded to Ygl8 and played an important role in regulating leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa)
YGL8|YL2	Chl biosynthesis	Map-based cloning and functional analysis of YGL8, which controls leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).	Independent of Chl biosynthesis and photosystem, YGL8 may affect the structure and function of chloroplasts grana lamellae by regulating plastid genome encoded thylakoid membrane constitutive gene expression and indirectly influences Chl biosynthesis
