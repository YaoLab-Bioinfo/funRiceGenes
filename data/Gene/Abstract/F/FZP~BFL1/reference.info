10.1007-s10681-011-0547-2.pdf	A novel frameshift mutant allele, fzp-10, affecting the panicle architecture of rice	2011	Euphytica	Faculty of Biology-Oriented Science and Technology, Kinki University, 930 Nishimitani, Kinokawa, Wakayama, 649-6493, Japan	The rice FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP) locus on chromosome 7, in which an ERF and acidic domain are present, is concerned with the regulation of spikelet meristem identity and the determination of panicle architecture. Many fzp mutants drastically alter panicle morphology with higher-order rachis-branches developing successively instead of the development of floral organs in these mutants. A new mutant showing the same fzp phenotype was induced by Î³-ray irradiation of seeds of a rice cultivar â€œGimbozuâ€<U+393C><U+3E64>. Examination of this fzp-like mutant for its allelism to a known allele of fzp-1, nucleotide sequence, and panicle and agronomic characteristics clearly indicated that the allele of this fzp-like mutant is located in FZP. Because there is a previously identified allele called fzp-9, we designated this new allele as fzp-10. fzp-10 has a single nucleotide (cytosine) deletion between the ERF domain and the acidic domain, which results in a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon, thereby altering the C-terminus of the encoded protein. The degree of higher-order branching in the panicles was significantly reduced in the fzp-10 mutant compared with that of fzp-1. Moreover, the fzp-10 mutant showed highly depressed culm and panicle lengths and panicle number, as well as delayed heading dates compared with its wild type and also with fzp-1. fzp-10 has several new characteristics, its altered nucleotide position and severity of phenotype alteration, and, therefore, could be a new gene resource to examine the function of FZP and the determination of rice panicle architecture.

Using a two-element Ac/Ds transposon tagging system we have isolated a rice mutant, designated branched floretless 1 (bfl1) which is defective in the transition from spikelet meristem to floret meristem. RESULTS: The bfl1 mutant shows normal differentiation of the primary rachis-branches leading to initial spikelet meristem (bract-like structure equivalent to rudimentary glumes) formation but fails to develop empty glumes and florets. Instead, axillary meristems in the bract-like structure produce sequential alternate branching, thus resulting in a coral shaped morphology of the branches in the developing panicle. The bfl1 mutant harbours a single Ds insertion in the upstream region of the BFL1 gene on chromosome 7 corresponding to PAC clone P0625E02 (GenBank Acc No. message URL http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=nucleotide&list_uid s=34395191&dopt=GenBank&term=ap004570AP004570). RT-PCR analyses revealed a drastic reduction of BFL1 transcript levels in the bfl1 mutant compared to that in the wild-type. In each of the normal panicle-bearing progeny plants, from occasional revertant seeds of the vegetatively-propagated mutant plant, Ds was shown to be excised from the bfl1 locus. BFL1 contains an EREBP/AP2 domain and is most likely an ortholog of the maize transcription factor gene BRANCHED SILKLESS1 (BD1). CONCLUSIONS: bfl1 is a Ds-tagged rice mutant defective in the transition from spikelet meristem (SM) to floret meristem (FM). BFL1 is most probably a rice ortholog of the maize ERF (EREBP/AP2) transcription factor gene BD1. Based on the similarities in mutant phenotypes bfl1 is likely to be an allele of the previously reported frizzy panicle locus.
Development-2003-Komatsu-3841-50.pdf	FRIZZY PANICLE is required to prevent the formation of axillary meristems and to establish floral meristem identity in rice spikelets	2003	Development	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Inflorescences of grass species have a distinct morphology in which florets are grouped in compact branches called spikelets. Although many studies have shown that the molecular and genetic mechanisms that control floret organ formation are conserved between monocots and dicots, little is known about the genetic pathway leading to spikelet formation. In the frizzy panicle (fzp) mutant of rice, the formation of florets is replaced by sequential rounds of branching. Detailed analyses revealed that several rudimentary glumes are formed in each ectopic branch, indicating that meristems acquire spikelet identity. However, instead of proceeding to floret formation, axillary meristems are formed in the axils of rudimentary glumes and they either arrest or develop into branches of higher order. The fzp mutant phenotype suggests that FZP is required to prevent the formation of axillary meristems within the spikelet meristem and permit the subsequent establishment of floral meristem identity. The FZP gene was isolated by transposon tagging. FZP encodes an ERF transcription factor and is the rice ortholog of the maize BD1 gene. Consistent with observations from phenotypic analyses, FZP expression was found to be restricted to the time of rudimentary glumes differentiation in a half-ring domain at the base of which the rudimentary glume primordium emerged.
j.1365-313X.2011.04804.x.pdf	Two AP2 family genes, supernumerary bract (SNB) and Osindeterminate spikelet 1 (OsIDS1), synergistically control inflorescence architecture and floral meristem establishment in rice	2012	Plant J	Department of Plant Molecular Systems Biotechnology, Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 446-701, Korea.	Meristem identity is crucial in determining the inflorescence architecture of grass species. We previously reported that SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) regulates the transition of spikelet meristems into floral meristems in rice (Oryza sativa). Here we demonstrated that SNB and Oryza sativa INDETERMINATE SPIKELET 1 (OsIDS1) together play important roles in inflorescence architecture and the establishment of floral meristems. In snb osids1 double mutants, the numbers of branches and spikelets within a panicle are significantly decreased, and the transition to a floral meristem is further delayed compared with the snb single mutant. Expression analyses showed that SNB and OsIDS1 are required for spatio-temporal expression of B- and E-function floral organ identity genes in the lodicules. In addition, the AP2 family genes are important for determining the degree of ramification in branch meristems, regulating the spatio-temporal expression of spikelet meristem genes, such as FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP). Furthermore, overexpression of microRNA172 (miR172) causes reductions in SNB and OsIDS1 transcript levels, and phenotypes of the transgenic plants are more severe than for snb osids1. This indicates that additional gene(s) participate in the development of branch and floral meristems. Preferential expression of mature miR172s in the area around the spikelet meristems implies that depletion of the AP2 family genes in those meristems via miR172 is an important step in controlling inflorescence branching and the formation of floral organs.
j.1601-5223.2005.01915.x.pdf	Morphological and molecular characterization of a new frizzy panicle mutant, "fzp-9(t)", in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2005	Hereditas	Yeongnam Agricultural Research Institute, NICS, RDA, Milyang, Korea.	The spikelet identity gene "fzp'' (frizzy panicle) is required for transformation of the floral meristems to inflorescent shoots. In fzp mutants, spikelets are replaced by branches and spikelet meristems produce massive numbers of branch meristems. We have isolated and characterized a new fzp mutant derived from anther culture lines in rice and designated as fzp-9 (t). The fzp-9 (t) mutant showed retarded growth habit and developed fewer tillers than those of the wild- type plant. The primary and secondary rachis branches of fzp-9 (t) appeared to be normal, but higher-order branches formed continuous bract- like structures without developing spikelets. The genetic segregation of fzp-9 (t) showed a good fit to the expected ratio of 3:1. The sequence analysis of fzp-9(t) revealed that there is a single nucleotide base change upstream of the ERF (ethylene-responsive element-binding factor) domain compare to wild-type plant. The mutation point of fzp-9 (t) (W66G) was one of the six amino acids of the ERF domain that contributed to GCC box-specific binding. The premature formation of a stop codon at the beginning of the ERF domain might cause a non-functional product.
NA	Regulatory role of FZP in the determination of panicle branching and spikelet formation in rice.	2016	Sci Rep	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	FRIZZLE PANICLE (FZP) and RFL/ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2 (APO2) play important roles in regulating the ABCDE floral organ identity genes. However, the relationships among FZP and these floral identity genes in the regulation of panicle formation remain unclear. Here, we used the novel mutant fzp-11, wild-type and FZP-overexpressing plants to compare the expression of these genes during panicle development by real-time PCR and in situ hybridization. The results indicate that FZP is a major negative regulator of RFL/APO2 and determines the transition from panicle branching to spikelet formation. Moreover, overexpression of FZP severely represses axillary meristem formation in both the vegetative and reproductive phases and the outgrowth of secondary branches in panicle. FZP overexpression positively regulates the expression of a subset of the class B genes, AGL6 genes (OsMADS6 and OsMADS17) as well as class E genes (OsMADS1, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8) in floral meristem (FM). Thus, it suggested that FZP could specify floral organ identity by regulating the related OsMADS-box genes.
NA	Duplication of an upstream silencer of FZP increases grain yield in rice.	2017	Nat Plants	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Transcriptional silencer and copy number variants (CNVs) are associated with gene expression. However, their roles in generating phenotypes have not been well studied. Here we identified a rice quantitative trait locus, SGDP7 (Small Grain and Dense Panicle 7). SGDP7 is identical to FZP (FRIZZY PANICLE), which represses the formation of axillary meristems. The causal mutation of SGDP7 is an 18-bp fragment, named CNV-18bp, which was inserted ~5.3<U+2009>kb upstream of FZP and resulted in a tandem duplication in the cultivar Chuan 7. The CNV-18bp duplication repressed FZP expression, prolonged the panicle branching period and increased grain yield by more than 15% through substantially increasing the number of spikelets per panicle (SPP) and slightly decreasing the 1,000-grain weight (TGW). The transcription repressor OsBZR1 binds the CGTG motifs in CNV-18bp and thereby represses FZP expression, indicating that CNV-18bp is the upstream silencer of FZP. These findings showed that the silencer CNVs coordinate a trade-off between SPP and TGW by fine-tuning FZP expression, and balancing the trade-off could enhance yield potential.
NA	FZP determines grain size and sterile lemma fate in rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	State Key Lab of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, P. R. China.	In grass, the spikelet is a unique inflorescence structure that directly determines grain yield. Despite a great deal of research, the molecular mechanisms behind spikelet development are not fully understood. In the study, FZP encodes an ERF domain protein, and functions in grain size and sterile lemma identity. Mutation of FZP causes smaller grains and degenerated sterile lemmas. The small fzp-12 grains were caused by a reduction in cell number and size in the hulls. Interestingly, the sterile lemma underwent a homeotic transformation into a rudimentary glume in the fzp-12 and fzp-13 mutants, whereas the sterile lemma underwent a homeotic transformation into a lemma in FZP over-expressing plants, suggesting that FZP specifically determines the sterile lemma identity. We confirmed the function of FZP by complementation, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, and cytological and molecular tests. Additionally, FZP interacts specifically with the GCC-box and DRE motifs, and may be involved in regulation of the downstream genes. Our results revealed that FZP plays a vital role in the regulation of grain size, and first provides clear evidence in support of the hypothesis that the lemma, rudimentary glume, and sterile lemma are homologous organs.
NA	Variation in FZP regulatory region causes increases of inflorescence secondary branches and grain yield in rice domestication.	2018	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, National Center for Evaluation of Agricultural Wild Plants (Rice), Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	Inflorescence branching is a key agronomical trait determining rice yield. The ancestral wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) primary branch bears few grains due to minimal secondary branching. By contrast, O. sativa cultivars have been selected to produce large panicles with more secondary branches. Here we showed that the CONTROL OF SECONDARY BRANCH 1 (COS1) gene, which is identical to FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP), plays an important role in the key transition from few secondary branches of wild rice to more secondary branches in domesticated rice cultivars. A 4-bp tandem repeat deletion in ~2.7-kb upstream of FZP may affect the binding activities of Auxin Response Factors (OsARFs) to the FZP promoter, decrease FZP expression level, and significantly enhance secondary branch number and grain yields in cultivated rice. Functional analyses showed that NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1), a trypsin-like serine and cysteine protease, interacted with FZP and promoted FZP degradation. Consistently, down-regulating FZP expression or up-regulating NAL1 expression in commercial cultivar Zhonghua 17 increased secondary branches per panicle, grain number per panicle, and grain yield per plant. Our findings not only provide insights into the molecular mechanism of increasing grain number and yield during rice domestication, but also offer favorable genes for grain yield improvement of rice.

NA	Comprehensive panicle phenotyping reveals that qSrn7/FZP influences higher-order branching.	2018	Sci Rep	Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Furo, Chikusa, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8601, Japan.	Rice grain number directly affects crop yield. Identifying alleles that improve panicle architecture would greatly aid the development of high-yield varieties. Here, we show that the quantitative trait locus qSrn7 contains rice FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP), a previously reported gene encoding an ERF transcription factor that promotes floral transition. Reduced expression of FZP in the reproductive stage increases the extent of higher order branching of the panicle, resulting in increased grain number. Genotype analysis of this gene in cultivars from the publicly available National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS) Core Collection demonstrated that the extent of higher order branching, especially in the upper panicle, was increased in those cultivars carrying the FZP allele associated with qSrn7. Furthermore, chromosome segment substitution lines resulting from a cross between Koshihikari and Kasalath, the latter of which carries qSrn7/FZP, also showed that upper panicle higher order branching and grain yield were increased by qSrn7/FZP. Our findings indicate that qSrn7/FZP influences panicle branching pattern and is thus useful in the breeding of high-yield rice varieties.
