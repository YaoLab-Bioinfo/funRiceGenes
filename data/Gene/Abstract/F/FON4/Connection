FON2|FON4|TG1	FOS1	FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice	Here we show that the FON2 SPARE1 (FOS1) gene encoding a CLE protein functions along with FON2 in maintenance of the FM
FON2|FON4|TG1	FOS1	FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice	Genetic analysis revealed that FOS1 does not need FON1, the putative receptor of FON2, for its action, suggesting that FOS1 and FON2 may function in meristem maintenance as signaling molecules in independent pathways
FON2|FON4|TG1	FOS1	FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice	Sequence comparison of FOS1 in about 150 domesticated rice and wild rice species indicates that this FNP is present only in japonica, suggesting that redundant regulation by FOS1 and FON2 is commonplace in species in the Oryza genus
FCP1|OsCLE402	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	Here, we report that two proteins closely related to CLAVATA3, FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1/Os CLE402), have functionally diversified to regulate the different types of meristem in rice (Oryza sativa)
FCP1|OsCLE402	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	Unlike FON2, which regulates the maintenance of flower and inflorescence meristems, FCP1 appears to regulate the maintenance of the vegetative SAM and RAM
FCP1|OsCLE402	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	FON1, a putative receptor of FON2, is likely to be unnecessary for these FCP1 functions
FCP1|OsCLE402	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	Furthermore, we identify a key amino acid residue that discriminates between the actions of FCP1 and FON2
FON1	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	FON1, a putative receptor of FON2, is likely to be unnecessary for these FCP1 functions
FON1	FON2|FON4|TG1	The floral organ number4 gene encoding a putative ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA3 regulates apical meristem size in rice	FON4 transcripts mainly accumulated in the small group of cells at the apex of the SAMs, whereas the rice ortholog of CLV1 (FON1) is expressed throughout the SAMs, suggesting that the putative FON4 ligand might be sequestered as a possible mechanism for rice meristem regulation
FON2|FON4|TG1	OSMADS3	Genetic Enhancer Analysis Reveals that FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 and OsMADS3 Cooperatively Regulate Maintenance and Determinacy of the Flower Meristem in Rice.	 Disruption of OsMADS3 in the fon2 mutant by CRISPR-Cas9 technology caused a flower phenotype similar to that of 2B-424, confirming that the gene responsible for enhancement of fon2 was OsMADS3
FON2|FON4|TG1	OSMADS3	Genetic Enhancer Analysis Reveals that FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 and OsMADS3 Cooperatively Regulate Maintenance and Determinacy of the Flower Meristem in Rice.	 Morphological analysis showed that the fon2 and osmads3 mutations synergistically affected pistil development and FM determinacy
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsMADS34|PAP2	Regulatory network and genetic interactions established by OsMADS34 in rice inflorescence and spikelet morphogenesis.	 Genetic analysis revealed that OsMADS34 controls different aspects of inflorescence structure, branching and meristem activity synergistically with LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), as evidenced by the enhanced phenotypes of osmads34 lax1 and osmads34 fon4 compared with the single mutants
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsPID	OsPINOID Regulates Stigma and Ovule Initiation through Maintenance of the Floral Meristem by Auxin Signaling.	 Moreover, the transcription of the floral meristem marker gene, OSH1, was down-regulated and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA3 (CLV3), was up-regulated in the pistil primordium of ospid
