10.1007-BF00226243.pdf	Genetic analysis of endosperm mutants in rice Oryza sativa L	1991	Theor Appl Genet	Division of Plant Breeding, Genetics, and Biochemistry, International Rice Research Institute, P.O. Box 933, Manila, Philippines.	Sugary, shrunken, floury, white core, amylose extender and dull mutants induced in japonica varieties were used in this study. The results of an allelic analysis conducted in japonica background indicated that the two sugary mutants 82GF and EM5 are allelic. The two amylose extender mutants 2064 and EM16 are also allelic. The opaque mutant ESD7-3(0) and floury mutants 2047, EM17 and EM28 are allelic as well and have the flo-1 gene. The three white core mutants EM3, EM24 and EM66 were found to be non-allelic. Eleven dull mutants were investigated. Dull mutants 2057, 2083, 2091 and EM15 were found to be allelic to each other. Similarly, dull mutants 2077, 2078 and 2120 have allelic genes. Dull mutants 2035, EM12, EM47, and EM98 are non-allelic to the above loci. Dull genes in EM12, EM15, and EM98 were designated earlier as du-1, du-2 and du-4, respectively.The mutant genes were transferred to indica background by two backcrosses to IR36. Some of the mutant genes were located to respective chromosomes through trisomic analysis using primary trisomics of IR36. In this way the amylose extender gene ae was located to chromosome 2, the flo-1 was located to chromosome 5 and the flo-2 to chromosome 4. Dull genes of EM47, 2120, and 2035 were assigned to chromosomes 6, 9, and 6, respectively.
Plant Cell-2010-She-tpc.109.070821.pdf	A novel factor FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 is involved in regulation of rice grain size and starch quality	2010	Plant Cell	Department of Biological Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm accumulates a massive amount of storage starch and storage proteins during seed development. However, little is known about the regulatory system involved in the production of storage substances. The rice flo2 mutation resulted in reduced grain size and starch quality. Map-based cloning identified FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2), a member of a novel gene family conserved in plants, as the gene responsible for the rice flo2 mutation. FLO2 harbors a tetratricopeptide repeat motif, considered to mediate a protein-protein interactions. FLO2 was abundantly expressed in developing seeds coincident with production of storage starch and protein, as well as in leaves, while abundant expression of its homologs was observed only in leaves. The flo2 mutation decreased expression of genes involved in production of storage starch and storage proteins in the endosperm. Differences between cultivars in their responsiveness of FLO2 expression during high-temperature stress indicated that FLO2 may be involved in heat tolerance during seed development. Overexpression of FLO2 enlarged the size of grains significantly. These results suggest that FLO2 plays a pivotal regulatory role in rice grain size and starch quality by affecting storage substance accumulation in the endosperm.
NA	Three novel alleles of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2) confer dull grains with low amylose content in rice.	2014	Plant Sci	Department of Agronomy, Chiayi Agricultural Experiment Station, Chiayi, Taiwan.	Rice is a major food source for much of the world, and expanding our knowledge of genes conferring specific rice grain attributes will benefit both farmer and consumer. Here we present novel dull grain mutants with a low amylose content (AC) derived from mutagenesis of Oryza sativa, ssp. japonica cv. Taikeng 8 (TK8). Positional cloning of the gene conferring the dull grain phenotype revealed a point mutation located at the acceptor splice site of intron 11 of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2), encoding a tetratricopeptide repeat domain (TPR)-containing protein. Three novel flo2 alleles were identified herein, which surprisingly conferred dull rather than floury grains. The allelic diversity of flo2 perturbed the expression of starch synthesis-related genes including OsAGPL2, OsAGPS2b, OsGBSSI, OsBEI, OsBEIIb, OsISA1, and OsPUL. The effect of the flo2 mutations on the physicochemical properties of the grain included a low breakdown, setback, and consistency of rice, indicating a good elasticity and soft texture of cooked rice grains. The effects of FLO2, combined with the genetic background of the germplasm and environmental effects, resulted in a variety of different amylose content levels, grain appearance, and physicochemical properties of rice, providing a host of useful information to future grain-quality research and breeding.
NA	Generation of new rice germplasms with low amylose content by CRISPR/CAS9-targeted mutagenesis of the FLOURY ENDOSPERM 2 gene.	2023	Front Plant Sci	School of Life Science, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.	FLOURY ENDOSPERM 2 (FLO2), encoding a tetratricopeptide repeat domain (TPR)-containing protein located in the nucleus, is considered to be a regulatory protein that controls the biosynthesis of seed storage substances. The diversity of flo2 allele is attributable for the variations in grain appearance, amylose content (AC), and physicochemical properties, influencing the eating and cooking quality (ECQ) of rice. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce loss-of-function mutations into the FLOURY ENDOSPERM 2 gene in Suken118 (SK118), a widely cultivated elite japonica rice variety in Jiangsu, China. Physiochemical analyses of the flo2 mutants were congruent with previous studies, exhibiting lowered AC and viscosity, risen gel consistency (GC) and gelatinization temperature (GT) values, which were all instrumental to the improvement of ECQ. However, the wrinkled opaque appearance and the decrease in grain width, grain thickness and grain weight imply trade-offs in grain yield. Despite the ex-ante estimation for low yielding, the superior ECQ in these novel genotypes generated by using genome editing approach may have the potential for formulating high value specialty food.
