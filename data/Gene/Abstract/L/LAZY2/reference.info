NA	LAZY2 controls rice tiller angle through regulating starch biosynthesis in gravity-sensing cells.	2021	New Phytol	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Rice (Oryza sativa) tiller angle is a key component for achieving ideal plant architecture and higher grain yield. However, the molecular mechanism underlying rice tiller angle remains elusive. We characterized a novel rice tiller angle mutant lazy2 (la2) and isolated the causative gene LA2 through map-based cloning. Biochemical, molecular and genetic studies were conducted to elucidate the LA2-involved tiller angle regulatory mechanism. The la2 mutant shows large tiller angle with impaired shoot gravitropism and defective asymmetric distribution of auxin. We found that starch granules in amyloplasts are completely lost in the gravity-sensing leaf sheath base cells of la2, whereas the seed development is not affected. LA2 encodes a novel chloroplastic protein that can interact with the starch biosynthetic enzyme Oryza sativa plastidic phosphoglucomutase (OspPGM) to regulate starch biosynthesis in rice shoot gravity-sensing cells. Genetic analysis showed that LA2 regulates shoot gravitropism and tiller angle by acting upstream of LA1 to mediate lateral auxin transport. Our studies revealed that LA2 acts as a novel regulator of rice tiller angle by specifically regulating starch biosynthesis in gravity-sensing cells, and established the framework of the starch-statolith-dependent rice tiller angle regulatory pathway, providing new insights into the rice tiller angle regulatory network.
