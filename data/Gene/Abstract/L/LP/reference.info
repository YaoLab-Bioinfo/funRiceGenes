Panicle architecture in rice can have a strong influence on yield. Using N-methyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis, we isolated an erect panicle mutant, Hep, from Hwasunchalbyeo, a glutinous japonica rice cultivar. Genetic analysis revealed that the erect panicle phenotype was controlled by a single recessive mutation designated erect panicle 3 (ep3). Genetic mapping revealed that the ep3 mutation was located on the short arm of chromosome 2 in a 0.1 cM region delimited by the STS markers STS5803-5 and STS5803-7. The ep3 locus corresponded to 46.8 kb region and contained six candidate genes. Comparison of the DNA sequences of the candidate genes from wild-type and erect panicle plants revealed a single base-pair change in the second exon of LOC_Os02g15950, which is predicted to result in a nonsense mutation. LOC_Os02g15950 encodes a putative F-box protein containing 515 amino acids and is expressed throughout the plant during all growth stages. A line carrying a T-DNA insertion in LOC_ Os02g15950 was obtained and shown to have the same phenotype as the ep3 mutant, thus confirming the identification of LOC_Os02g15950 as the ERECT PANICLE 3 (EP3) gene. The ep3 mutation causes a significant increase in the number of small vascular bundles as well as the thickness of parenchyma in the peduncle, which results in the erect panicle phenotype.
j.1467-7652.2011.00610.x.pdf	Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Panicle architecture is one of the most important agronomical traits that directly contribute to grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We report herein an in-depth characterization of two allelic larger panicle (lp) mutants that show significantly increased panicle size as well as improved plant architecture. Morphological analyses reveal that panicles of two mutants produced more inflorescence branches, especially the primary branches, and contained more grains. Moreover, mutant plants also display more lodging resistance than the wild type. The grain yield per plant in mutants is also increased, suggesting that mutant plants have useful potential for high grain yield in rice breeding. Map-based cloning reveals that LARGER PANICLE (LP) encodes a Kelch repeat-containing F-box protein. RNA in situ hybridization studies display that LP expression was enriched in the branch primordial region. Subcellular localization analyses demonstrate that LP is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein, suggesting that LP might be involved in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Using yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis, we confirm that LP is an F-box protein and could interact with rice SKP1-like protein in an F-box domain-dependent manner. Quantitative real-time PCR results show that OsCKX2, which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, is down-regulated evidently in mutants, implying that LP might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues. These results suggest that LP plays an important role in regulating plant architecture, particularly in regulating panicle architecture, thereby representing promising targets for genetic improvement of grain production plants.
NA	Decreased photosynthesis in the erect panicle 3 (ep3) mutant of rice is associated with reduced stomatal conductance and attenuated guard cell development.	2015	J Exp Bot	Plant and Crop Sciences Division, School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham LE12 5RD, UK.	The ERECT PANICLE 3 gene of rice encodes a peptide that exhibits more than 50% sequence identity with the Arabidopsis F-box protein HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS). Ectopic expression of the Os02g15950 coding sequence, driven by the HWS (At3g61950) promoter, rescued the hws-1 flower phenotype in Arabidopsis confirming that EP3 is a functional orthologue of HWS. In addition to displaying an erect inflorescence phenotype, loss-of-function mutants of Os02g15950 exhibited a decrease in leaf photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance. Analysis of a range of physiological and anatomical features related to leaf photosynthesis revealed no alteration in Rubisco content and no notable changes in mesophyll size or arrangement. However, both ep3 mutant plants and transgenic lines that have a T-DNA insertion within the Os02g15950 (EP3) gene exhibit smaller stomatal guard cells compared with their wild-type controls. This anatomical characteristic may account for the observed decrease in leaf photosynthesis and provides evidence that EP3 plays a role in regulating stomatal guard cell development.
NA	The Rice EP3 and OsFBK1 E3 ligases alter plant architecture and flower development, and affect transcript accumulation of microRNA pathway genes and their targets.	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	Plant and Crop Sciences Division, School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, LE12 5RD, UK.	ERECTA PANICLE 3 (EP3) and ORYZA SATIVA F-BOX KELCH 1 (OsFBK1) proteins share 57% and 54% sequence identity with the Arabidopsis F-box protein HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS). Previously we showed that EP3 is a functional orthologue of HWS. Here we demonstrate that OsFBK1 is another functional orthologue of HWS and show the complexity of interaction between EP3 and OsFBK1 genes at different developmental stages of the plant. qRT-PCR expression analyses and studies of EP3-GFP and OsFBK1-RFP promoter reporter lines demonstrate that although EP3 and OsFBK1 expression can be detected in the same tissues some cells exclusively express EP3 or OsFBK1 whilst others co-express both genes. Loss, reduction or gain of function lines for EP3 and OsFBK1, show that EP3 and OsFBK1 affect plant architecture, organ size, floral organ number and size, floral morphology, pollen viability, grain size and weight. We have identified the putative orthologue genes of the rice microRNA pathway for ORYZA SATIVA DAWDLE (OsDDL) and ORYZA SATIVA SERRATE (OsSE), and demonstrated that EP3 and OsFBK1 affect their transcript levels as well as those of CROWN ROOT DEFECT 1/ORYZA SATIVA Exportin-5 HASTY (CRD1/OsHST), ORYZA SATIVA DICER-LIKE 1 (OsDCL) and ORYZA SATIVA WEAVY LEAF1 (OsWAF1). We show that EP3 affects OsPri-MIR164, OsNAM1 and OsNAC1 transcript levels. OsNAC1 transcripts are modified by OsFBK1, suggesting two independent regulatory pathways, one via EP3 and OsMIR164 and the other via OsFBK1. Our data propose EP3 and OsFBK1 conjointly play similar roles in rice as HWS does in Arabidopsis.
