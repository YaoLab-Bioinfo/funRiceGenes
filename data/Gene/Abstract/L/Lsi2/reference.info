The rice (Oryza sativa) silicon transporter Lsi1 (OsNIP2;1, an aquaporin channel) is the major entry route of arsenite into rice roots. Whether Lsi1 also mediates arsenite efflux was investigated. *Expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes enhanced arsenite efflux, indicating that Lsi1 facilitates arsenite transport bidirectionally. *Arsenite was the predominant arsenic species in arsenate-exposed rice plants. During 24-h exposure to 5 mum arsenate, rice roots extruded arsenite to the external medium rapidly, accounting for 60-90% of the arsenate uptake. A rice mutant defective in Lsi1 (lsi1) extruded significantly less arsenite than the wild-type rice and, as a result, accumulated more arsenite in the roots. By contrast, Lsi2 mutation had little effect on arsenite efflux to the external medium. *We conclude that Lsi1 plays a role in arsenite efflux in rice roots exposed to arsenate. However, this pathway accounts for only 15-20% of the total efflux, suggesting the existence of other efflux transporters.
nature05964.pdf	An efflux transporter of silicon in rice	2007	Nature	Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan. maj@rib.okayama-u.ac.jp	Silicon is an important nutrient for the optimal growth and sustainable production of rice. Rice accumulates up to 10% silicon in the shoot, and this high accumulation is required to protect the plant from multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. A gene, Lsi1, that encodes a silicon influx transporter has been identified in rice. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, low silicon rice 2 (Lsi2), which has no similarity to Lsi1. This gene is constitutively expressed in the roots. The protein encoded by this gene is localized, like Lsi1, on the plasma membrane of cells in both the exodermis and the endodermis, but in contrast to Lsi1, which is localized on the distal side, Lsi2 is localized on the proximal side of the same cells. Expression of Lsi2 in Xenopus oocytes did not result in influx transport activity for silicon, but preloading of the oocytes with silicon resulted in a release of silicon, indicating that Lsi2 is a silicon efflux transporter. The identification of this silicon transporter revealed a unique mechanism of nutrient transport in plants: having an influx transporter on one side and an efflux transporter on the other side of the cell to permit the effective transcellular transport of the nutrients.
Plant Physiol.-2007-Ma-919-24.pdf	Genotypic difference in silicon uptake and expression of silicon transporter genes in rice	2007	Plant Physiol	Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan. maj@rib.okayama-u.ac.jp	Rice (Oryza sativa) is a highly silicon (Si)-accumulating species that shows genotypic differences in Si accumulation. We investigated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in the genotypic difference in Si uptake between the japonica var. Nipponbare and the indica var. Kasalath. Both the Si concentration in the shoot and the Si uptake per root dry weight were higher in Nipponbare than in Kasalath grown in either soil or nutrient solution. The Si uptake by a single root was also higher in Nipponbare than in Kasalath. A kinetics study showed that Nipponbare and Kasalath had a similar K(m) value, whereas the V(max) was higher in Nipponbare. The expression of two Si transporter genes (Low silicon rice 1 [Lsi1] and Lsi2) investigated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed higher expression of both genes in Nipponbare than in Kasalath. Immunostaining with Lsi1 and Lsi2 antibodies revealed a similar pattern of subcellular localization of these two Si transporters in both varieties; Lsi1 and Lsi2 were localized at the distal and proximal sides, respectively, of both exodermis and endodermis of the roots. These results revealed that the genotypic difference in the Si accumulation results from the difference in abundance of Si transporters in rice roots.
Plant Physiol.-2009-Li-2071-80.pdf	The rice aquaporin Lsi1 mediates uptake of methylated arsenic species	2009	Plant Physiol	Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, Hertfordshire AL5 2JQ, United Kingdom.	Pentavalent methylated arsenic (As) species such as monomethylarsonic acid [MMA(V)] and dimethylarsinic acid [DMA(V)] are used as herbicides or pesticides, and can also be synthesized by soil microorganisms or algae through As methylation. The mechanism of MMA(V) and DMA(V) uptake remains unknown. Recent studies have shown that arsenite is taken up by rice (Oryza sativa) roots through two silicon transporters, Lsi1 (the aquaporin NIP2;1) and Lsi2 (an efflux carrier). Here we investigated whether these two transporters also mediate the uptake of MMA(V) and DMA(V). MMA(V) was partly reduced to trivalent MMA(III) in rice roots, but only MMA(V) was translocated to shoots. DMA(V) was stable in plants. The rice lsi1 mutant lost about 80% and 50% of the uptake capacity for MMA(V) and DMA(V), respectively, compared with the wild-type rice, whereas Lsi2 mutation had little effect. The short-term uptake kinetics of MMA(V) can be described by a Michaelis-Menten plus linear model, with the wild type having 3.5-fold higher V(max) than the lsi1 mutant. The uptake kinetics of DMA(V) were linear with the slope being 2.8-fold higher in the wild type than the lsi1 mutant. Heterologous expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes significantly increased the uptake of MMA(V) but not DMA(V), possibly because of a very limited uptake of the latter. Uptake of MMA(V) and DMA(V) by wild-type rice was increased as the pH of the medium decreased, consistent with an increasing proportion of the undissociated species. The results demonstrate that Lsi1 mediates the uptake of undissociated methylated As in rice roots.
PNAS-2008-Ma-9931-5.pdf	Transporters of arsenite in rice and their role in arsenic accumulation in rice grain	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan. maj@rib.okayama-u.ac.jp	Arsenic poisoning affects millions of people worldwide. Human arsenic intake from rice consumption can be substantial because rice is particularly efficient in assimilating arsenic from paddy soils, although the mechanism has not been elucidated. Here we report that two different types of transporters mediate transport of arsenite, the predominant form of arsenic in paddy soil, from the external medium to the xylem. Transporters belonging to the NIP subfamily of aquaporins in rice are permeable to arsenite but not to arsenate. Mutation in OsNIP2;1 (Lsi1, a silicon influx transporter) significantly decreases arsenite uptake. Furthermore, in the rice mutants defective in the silicon efflux transporter Lsi2, arsenite transport to the xylem and accumulation in shoots and grain decreased greatly. Mutation in Lsi2 had a much greater impact on arsenic accumulation in shoots and grain in field-grown rice than Lsi1. Arsenite transport in rice roots therefore shares the same highly efficient pathway as silicon, which explains why rice is efficient in arsenic accumulation. Our results provide insight into the uptake mechanism of arsenite in rice and strategies for reducing arsenic accumulation in grain for enhanced food safety.
NA	High Silicon Accumulation in the Shoot is Required for Down-Regulating the Expression of Si Transporter Genes in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki, 710-0046 Japan.	Rice requires high silicon (Si) for its high and sustainable yield. The efficient uptake of Si in rice is mediated by two transporters OsLsi1 and OsLsi2, which function as influx and efflux transporters, respectively. Our previous studies showed that the mRNA expression levels of these transporter genes were down-regulated by Si. Herein we investigated the mechanism underlying regulation of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 expression. There was a negative correlation between the expression level of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 and shoot Si accumulation when the rice seedlings were exposed to different Si supply conditions. A split root experiment showed that the expression of both OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 was also down-regulated in half the roots without direct Si exposure when the other half of the roots were exposed to Si. Analysis with transgenic rice carrying different lengths of OsLsi1 promoter regions fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter gene revealed that the region responsible for the Si response of OsLsi1 expression is present between -327 to -292 in the promoter. However, this region was not associated with the tissue and cellular localization of OsLsi1. In conclusion, the Si-induced down-regulation of Si transporter genes is controlled by shoot Si, not root Si, and the region between -327 and -292 in the OsLsi1 promoter is involved in this regulation of OsLsi1 expression in rice.
NA	Altered root structure affects both expression and cellular localization of transporters for mineral element uptake in rice.	2019	Plant Cell Physiol	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki, Japan.	One of the most important roles of plant roots is to take up mineral elements for their growth. Although several genes involved in root growth have been identified, the association between root structure and mineral element uptake is less investigated. Here, we isolated a rice mutant (dice1, defective in cell elongation 1) with short root phenotype. This mutant was characterized by partial defect in the formation of root outer cell layers. Mapping of the responsible gene revealed that the short-root phenotype in the mutant was caused by a single nucleotide substitution of a gene encoding a membrane-anchored endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (OsGlu3). The growth of both the roots and shoots was partially recovered with increasing strength of nutrient solution and glucose in the mutant. The mutant showed a decreased uptake (normalized by root dry weight) for Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, As and Ge, but increased uptake for K and Ca. The expression level of some transporter genes including OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 for Si uptake and OsNramp5 for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice. Furthermore, the cellular localization of OsLsi1 was altered; OsLsi1 localized at the root exodermis of the wild-type rice was changed to be localized to other cell layers of the mutant roots. However, this localization became normal in the presence of exogenous glucose in the mutant. Our results indicate that a normal root structure is required for maintaining the expression and localization of transporters involved in the mineral element uptake.
