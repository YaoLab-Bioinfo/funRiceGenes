tpj12328.pdf	A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination	2013	The Plant Journal	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China	Seed germination and innate immunity both have significant effects on plant life spans because they control the plant's entry into the ecosystem and provide defenses against various external stresses, respectively. Much ecological evidence has shown that seeds with high vigor are generally more tolerant of various environmental stimuli in the field than those with low vigor. However, there is little genetic evidence linking germination and immunity in plants. Here, we show that the rice lectin receptor-like kinase OslecRK contributes to both seed germination and plant innate immunity. We demonstrate that knocking down the OslecRK gene depresses the expression of Î±â€“amylase genes, reducing seed viability and thereby decreasing the rate of seed germination. Moreover, it also inhibits the expression of defense genes, and so reduces the resistance of rice plants to fungal and bacterial pathogens as well as herbivorous insects. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OslecRK interacts with an actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) in vivo via its kinase domain. Moreover, the rice adf mutant exhibited a reduced seed germination rate due to the suppression of Î±â€“amylase gene expression. This mutant also exhibited depressed immune responses and reduced resistance to biotic stresses. Our results thus provide direct genetic evidence for a common physiological pathway connecting germination and immunity in plants. They also partially explain the common observation that high-vigor seeds often perform well in the field. The dual effects of OslecRK may be indicative of progressive adaptive evolution in rice.
NA	A gene cluster encoding lectin receptor kinases confers broad-spectrum and durable insect resistance in rice	2014	Nature Biotechnology	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most destructive pest of rice (Oryza sativa) and a substantial threat to rice production, causing losses of billions of dollars annually1, 2. Breeding of resistant cultivars is currently hampered by the rapid breakdown of BPH resistance2. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify more effective BPH-resistance genes. Here, we report molecular cloning and characterization of Bph3, a locus in rice identified more than 30 years ago that confers resistance to BPH. We show that Bph3 is a cluster of three genes encoding plasma membrane¨Clocalized lectin receptor kinases (OsLecRK1-OsLecRK3). Introgression of Bph3 into susceptible rice varieties by transgenic or marker-assisted selection strategies significantly enhanced resistance to both the BPH and the white back planthopper. Our results suggest that these lectin receptor kinase genes function together to confer broad-spectrum and durable insect resistance and provide a resource for molecular breeding of insect-resistant rice cultivars.
NA	Poaceae-specific Î²-1,3;1,4-d-glucans link jasmonate signalling to OsLecRK1-mediated defence response during rice-brown planthopper interactions.	2023	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.	Brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), a highly destructive insect pest, poses a serious threat to rice (Oryza sativa) production worldwide. Jasmonates are key phytohormones that regulate plant defences against BPH; however, the molecular link between jasmonates and BPH responses in rice remains largely unknown. Here, we discovered a Poaceae-specific metabolite, mixed-linkage Î²-1,3;1,4-d-glucan (MLG), which contributes to jasmonate-mediated BPH resistance. MLG levels in rice significantly increased upon BPH attack. Overexpressing OsCslF6, which encodes a glucan synthase that catalyses MLG biosynthesis, significantly enhanced BPH resistance and cell wall thickness in vascular bundles, whereas knockout of OsCslF6 reduced BPH resistance and vascular wall thickness. OsMYC2, a master transcription factor of jasmonate signalling, directly controlled the upregulation of OsCslF6 in response to BPH feeding. The AT-rich domain of the OsCslF6 promoter varies in rice varieties from different locations and natural variants in this domain were associated with BPH resistance. MLG-derived oligosaccharides bound to the plasma membrane-anchored LECTIN RECEPTOR KINASE1 OsLecRK1 and modulated its activity. Thus, our findings suggest that the OsMYC2-OsCslF6 module regulates pest resistance by modulating MLG production to enhance vascular wall thickness and OsLecRK1-mediated defence signalling during rice-BPH interactions.
