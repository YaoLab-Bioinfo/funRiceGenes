OslecRK|OsLecRK1	seed germination	A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination	Here, we show that the rice lectin receptor-like kinase OslecRK contributes to both seed germination and plant innate immunity
OslecRK|OsLecRK1	seed germination	A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination	We demonstrate that knocking down the OslecRK gene depresses the expression of α–amylase genes, reducing seed viability and thereby decreasing the rate of seed germination

OslecRK|OsLecRK1	plasma membrane	Poaceae-specific β-1,3;1,4-d-glucans link jasmonate signalling to OsLecRK1-mediated defence response during rice-brown planthopper interactions.	 MLG-derived oligosaccharides bound to the plasma membrane-anchored LECTIN RECEPTOR KINASE1 OsLecRK1 and modulated its activity
