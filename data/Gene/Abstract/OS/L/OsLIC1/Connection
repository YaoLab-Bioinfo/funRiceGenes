ILI1	LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1
ILI1	LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Here, we demonstrate that Oryza sativa LEAF and TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (LIC) acts as an antagonistic transcription factor of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) to attenuate the BR signaling pathway
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	The gain-of-function mutant lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines showed erect leaves, similar to BZR1-depleted lines, which indicates the opposite roles of LIC and BZR1 in regulating leaf bending
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	For negative feedback, LIC bound to the core element CTCGC in the BZR1 promoter on gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and repressed its transcription on transient transformation assay
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Phenotypic analysis of the crossed lines depleted in both LIC and BZR1 suggested that BZR1 functionally depends on LIC
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Molecular and physiology assays revealed that LIC plays a dominant role at high BR levels, whereas BZR1 is dominant at low levels
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Thus, LIC regulates rice leaf bending as an antagonistic transcription factor of BZR1
LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	SRS3|OsKINESIN-13A|BHS1	The kinesin-13 protein BR HYPERSENSITIVE 1 is a negative brassinosteroid signaling component regulating rice growth and development.	 Furthermore, we found that the BR-induced degradation of BHS1 was attenuated in Osbri1 and Osbak1 mutants, but not in Osbzr1 and Oslic mutants
