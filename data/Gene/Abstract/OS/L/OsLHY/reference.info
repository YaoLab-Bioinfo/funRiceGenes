Plant Cell Physiol-2003-Murakami-1229-36.pdf	The evolutionarily conserved OsPRR quintet: rice pseudo-response regulators implicated in circadian rhythm	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, School of Agriculture, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8601 Japan.	In Arabidopsis thaliana, a number of circadian-associated factors have been identified, including TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1) that is believed to be a component of the central oscillator. TOC1 is a member of a small family of proteins, designated as ARABIDOPSIS PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORS (APRR1/TOC1, APRR3, APRR5, APRR7, and APRR9). As demonstrated previously, these APRR1/TOC1 quintet members are crucial for a better understanding of the molecular links between circadian rhythms, control of flowering time through photoperiodic pathways, and also photosensory signal transduction in this dicotyledonous plant. In this respect, both the dicotyledonous (e.g. A. thaliana) and monocotyledonous (e.g. Oryza sativa) plants might share the evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism underlying the circadian rhythm. Based on such an assumption, and as the main objective of this study, we asked the question of whether rice also has a set of pseudo-response regulators, and if so, whether or not they are associated with the circadian rhythm. Here we showed that rice has five members of the OsPRR family (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator), and also that the expressions of these OsPRR genes are under the control of circadian rhythm. They are expressed in a diurnal and sequential manner in the order of OsPRR73 (OsPRR37)-->OsPRR95 (OsPRR59)-->OsPRR1, which is reminiscent of the circadian waves of the APRR1/TOC1 quintet in A. thaliana. These and other results of this study suggested that the OsPRR quintet, including the ortholog of APRR1/TOC1, might play important roles within, or close to, the circadian clock of rice.
pp1520808.pdf	The role of casein kinase II in flowering time regulation has diversified during evolution	2010	Plant Physiol	University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan 305-8577.	Casein kinase II (CK2) is a protein kinase with an evolutionarily conserved function as a circadian clock component in several organisms, including the long-day plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The circadian clock component CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) is a CK2 target in Arabidopsis, where it influences photoperiodic flowering. In rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant, Heading date6 (Hd6) encodes a CK2alpha subunit that delays flowering time under long-day conditions. Here, we demonstrate that control of flowering time in rice by the Hd6 CK2alpha subunit requires a functional Hd1 gene (an Arabidopsis CONSTANS ortholog) and is independent of the circadian clock mechanism. Our findings from overexpressing the dominant-negative CK2 allele in rice support the independence of CK2 function from the circadian clock. This lack of control of the circadian clock by Hd6 CK2alpha might be due to the presence of glutamate in OsLHY (a CCA1 ortholog in rice) instead of the serine at the corresponding CK2 target site in CCA1. However, this glutamate is critical for the control of the OsPRR1 gene (a rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis TOC1/PRR1 gene) by OsLHY for regulation of the circadian clock. We also demonstrated that the other conserved CK2 target sites in OsLHY conferred robust rhythmic expression of OsLHY-LUC under diurnal conditions. These findings imply that the role of CK2 in flowering-time regulation in higher plants has diversified during evolution.
NA	Nitrogen Mediates Flowering Time and Nitrogen Use Efficiency via Floral Regulators in Rice	2020	Curr Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	High nitrogen (N) fertilization for maximizing crop yield commonly leads to postponed flowering time (heading date in rice) and ripening, thus affecting resources use efficiency and followed planting time. We found that N-mediated heading date-1 (Nhd1) can directly activate florigen gene OsHd3a in rice. Inactivation of either Nhd1 or OsHd3a results in delay and insensitivity to N supply of flowering time. Knockout of Nhd1 increases N uptake and utilization efficiency at low-to-moderate N level under both short- and long-day field conditions. Increasing glutamine, the product of N assimilation, can upregulate expression of Nhd1, which in turn downregulates OsFd-GOGAT expression and OsFd-GOGAT activity, displaying a Nhd1-controlled negative feedback regulatory pathway of N assimilation. Moreover, N fertilization effect on rice flowering time shows genetically controlled diversity, and single-nucleotide polymorphism in Nhd1 promoter may relate to different responses of flowering time to N application. Nhd1 thus balances flowering time and N use efficiency in addition to photoperiod in rice.
NA	Clock component OsPRR73 positively regulates rice salt tolerance by modulating OsHKT2;1-mediated sodium homeostasis	2020	EMBO J	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The roles of clock components in salt stress tolerance remain incompletely characterized in rice. Here, we show that, among OsPRR (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator) family members, OsPRR73 specifically confers salt tolerance in rice. Notably, the grain size and yield of osprr73 null mutants were significantly decreased in the presence of salt stress, with accumulated higher level of reactive oxygen species and sodium ions. RNA sequencing and biochemical assays identified OsHKT2;1, encoding a plasma membrane-localized Na+ transporter, as a transcriptional target of OsPRR73 in mediating salt tolerance. Correspondingly, null mutants of OsHKT2;1 displayed an increased tolerance to salt stress. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays further identified HDAC10 as nuclear interactor of OsPRR73 and co-repressor of OsHKT2;1. Consistently, H3K9ac histone marks at OsHKT2;1 promoter regions were significantly reduced in osprr73 mutant. Together, our findings reveal that salt-induced OsPRR73 expression confers salt tolerance by recruiting HDAC10 to transcriptionally repress OsHKT2;1, thus reducing cellular Na+ accumulation. This exemplifies a new molecular link between clock components and salt stress tolerance in rice.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
NA	The transcriptional repressor OsPRR73 links circadian clock and photoperiod pathway to control heading date in rice	2020	Plant Cell Environ	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	The phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is triggered by internal and external signals that participate in circadian clock in plants. We identified a rice floral inhibitor OsPRR73 encoding a CONSTANS protein. Overexpression of OsPRR73 resulted in late heading under both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions. Knockout mutants led to early heading under LD conditions but no change under SD. OsPRR73 mRNA accumulated at noon and exhibited a robust oscillation under constant light (LL) and constant darkness (DD) conditions. OsPRR73 overexpression exerted negative feedback on endogenous OsPRR73 expression and altered diurnal expressions of key flowering genes and circadian clock genes. OsPRR73 bound to the promoters of the floral gene Ehd1 and the circadian gene OsLHY, and significantly suppressed their expression at dawn. In LL and DD, the oscillatory patterns of the circadian genes OsLHY, OsTOC1, OsGI and OsELF3 were varied in OsPRR73OX and osprr73 mutants. OsPRR73 expression was decreased in osphyb mutants, and overexpression of OsPRR73 complemented the early heading date phenotype of osphyb, indicating OsPRR73 works downstream of OsPhyB. Therefore, OsPRR73 is involved in a feedback loop of the rice clock and connects the photoperiod flowering pathway by binding to the Ehd1 promoter in rice.
