OsLFNR1|LFNR1	OsLFNR2|LFNR2	Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis	We found, by taking advantage of a gain-of-function approach, that expression of two rice (Oryza sativa) full-length cDNAs of leaf-type FNRs (OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2) led to altered chlorophyll fluorescence and growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice
OsLFNR1|LFNR1	OsLFNR2|LFNR2	Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis	We revealed that overexpression of the OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2 full-length cDNAs resulted in distinct phenotypes despite the high sequence similarity between them
OsLFNR1|LFNR1	OsLFNR2|LFNR2	Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis	The endogenous protein level of OsLFNR was found to be suppressed in both OsLFNR1- and OsLFNR2-overexpressing rice plants, leading to changes in the stoichiometry of the two LFNR isoforms within the thylakoid and soluble fractions
OsLFNR1|LFNR1	OsLFNR2|LFNR2	Characterizing membrane anchoring of leaf-form ferredoxin-NADP(+) oxidoreductase in rice.	 OsLFNR1 attachment through a membrane anchor depends on OsLFNR2, unlike the Arabidopsis counterparts
