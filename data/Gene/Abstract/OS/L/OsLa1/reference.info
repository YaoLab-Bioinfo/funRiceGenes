La proteins are found widely in eukaryotes and play a variety of vital roles. AtLa1 has been identified as an La protein that is necessary for embryogenesis in Arabidopsis; however, the existence and biological functions of La proteins in rice (Oryza sativa L.) remain unclear. In this study, we identified and characterized two La proteins in rice that are homologous to AtLa1 and named them OsLa1 and OsLa2. Both the OsLa1 and OsLa2 genes encode RNA-binding proteins with an La domain and two RNA-binding domains. Mutant OsLa1 reduced grain length and pollen fertility, whereas OsLa1 overexpression caused the opposite phenotypes. Further experiments indicated that OsLa1 modulates grain size by influencing cell expansion. Interestingly, mutant OsLa2 resulted in thin grains with decreased weight and a low seed-setting rate. We also found that OsLa1 interacted with OsLa2 and that both OsLa1 and OsLa2 interacted with OseIF6.1, a eukaryotic translation initiation factor involved in ribosome biogenesis. In addition, OsLa1 was able to bind to OseIF6.1 mRNA to modulate its expression. Complete OseIF6.1 knockout caused lethality and OseIF6.1/oseif6.1 heterozygous plants displayed low fertility and low seed setting. Together, our results enrich our knowledge of the role of La proteins in rice growth and development, as well as the relationship between La and eIF6 in rice.
