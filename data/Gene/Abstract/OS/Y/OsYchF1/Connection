OsGAP1	OsYchF1	An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein	Using the OsYchF1-OsGAP1 pair from rice as the prototype, we provide evidence for the regulation of GTPase/ATPase activities and RNA binding capacity of a plant YchF (OsYchF1) by its regulatory protein (OsGAP1)
OsGAP1	OsYchF1	An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein	The effects of OsGAP1 on the subcellular localization/cycling and physiological functions of OsYchF1 are also discussed
OsGAP1	OsYchF1	An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein	The finding that OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 are involved in plant defense response might shed light on the functional roles of YchF homologues in plants
OsGAP1	OsYchF1	Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).	Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).
OsGAP1	OsYchF1	Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).	We have previously reported that a member of this group, OsGAP1, is able to alleviate salt stress and stimulate defense responses, and bind to both phospholipids and an unconventional G-protein, OsYchF1
OsGAP1	OsYchF1	Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).	On the other hand, the ability to alleviate salt stress by OsGAP1 is dependent only on its ability to bind OsYchF1 and is independent of its phospholipid-binding activity
OsFKBP12	OsYchF1	A Rice Immunophilin Homolog, OsFKBP12, Is a Negative Regulator of Both Biotic and Abiotic Stress Responses	 Using yeast two-hybrid tests, an ancient unconventional G-protein, OsYchF1, was identified as an interacting partner of OsFKBP12
