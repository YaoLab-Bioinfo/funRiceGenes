OsYABBY4|TOB2	sd1|GA20ox2	The rice YABBY4 gene regulates plant growth and development through modulating the gibberellin pathway.	We report on an important role for OsYABBY4 in negative control of the expression of a GA biosynthetic gene by binding to the promoter region of the gibberellin 20-oxidase 2 gene (GA20ox2), which is a direct target of SLR1 (the sole DELLA protein negatively controlling GA responses in rice)
OsYABBY4|TOB2	SLR1|OsGAI	The rice YABBY4 gene regulates plant growth and development through modulating the gibberellin pathway.	We report on an important role for OsYABBY4 in negative control of the expression of a GA biosynthetic gene by binding to the promoter region of the gibberellin 20-oxidase 2 gene (GA20ox2), which is a direct target of SLR1 (the sole DELLA protein negatively controlling GA responses in rice)
OsYABBY4|TOB2	SLR1|OsGAI	The rice YABBY4 gene regulates plant growth and development through modulating the gibberellin pathway.	OsYABBY4 also suppresses the expression level of SLR1 and interacts with SLR1 protein
OsYABBY4|TOB2	SLR1|OsGAI	The rice YABBY4 gene regulates plant growth and development through modulating the gibberellin pathway.	These data together suggest that OsYABBY4 serves as a DNA-binding intermediate protein for SLR1 and is associated with the GA signaling pathway regulating gene expression during plant growth and development
