MAPK kinase kinase, , an ortholog of , reveal its role in defense/stress signalling pathways and development	2003	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Science, Sejong University, Seoul 143-747, Republic of Korea.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade(s) is important for plant defense/stress responses. Though MAPKs have been identified and characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L.), a monocot cereal crop research model, the first upstream component of the kinase cascade, namely MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) has not yet been identified. Here we report the cloning of a novel rice gene encoding a MAPKKK, OsEDR1, designated based on its homology with the Arabidopsis MAPKKK, AtEDR1. OsEDR1, a single copy gene in the genome of rice, encodes a predicted protein with molecular mass of 113046.13 and a pI of 9.03. Using our established two-week-old rice seedling in vitro model system, we show that OsEDR1 has a constitutive expression in seedling leaves and is further up-regulated within 15 min upon wounding by cut, treatment with the global signals jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ethephon, ET), abscisic acid, and hydrogen peroxide. In addition, protein phosphatase inhibitors, fungal elicitor chitosan, drought, high salt and sugar, and heavy metals also dramatically induce its expression. Moreover, OsEDR1 expression was altered by co-application of JA, SA, and ET, and required de novo synthesized protein factor(s) in its transient regulation. Furthermore, using an in vivo system we also show that OsEDR1 responds to changes in temperature and environmental pollutants-ozone and sulfur dioxide. Finally, OsEDR1 expression varied significantly in vegetative and reproductive tissues. These results suggest a role for OsEDR1 in defense/stress signalling pathways and development.

Rice OsEDR1 is a sequence ortholog of Arabidopsis EDR1. However, its molecular function is unknown. We show here that OsEDR1-suppressing/knockout (KO) plants, which developed spontaneous lesions on the leaves, have enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causing bacterial blight disease. This resistance was associated with increased accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), induced expression of SA- and JA-related genes and suppressed accumulation of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), the direct precursor of ethylene, and expression of ethylene-related genes. OsEDR1-KO plants also showed suppressed production of ethylene. Knockout of OsEDR1 suppressed the ACC synthase (ACS) gene family, which encodes the rate-limiting enzymes of ethylene biosynthesis by catalysing the formation of ACC. The lesion phenotype and enhanced bacterial resistance of the OsEDR1-KO plants was partly complemented by the treatment with ACC. ACC treatment was associated with decreased SA and JA biosynthesis in OsEDR1-KO plants. In contrast, aminoethoxyvinylglycine, the inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis, promoted expression of SA and JA synthesis-related genes in OsEDR1-KO plants. These results suggest that ethylene is a negative signalling molecule in rice bacterial resistance. In the rice-Xoo interaction, OsEDR1 transcriptionally promotes the synthesis of ethylene that, in turn, suppresses SA- and JA-associated defence signalling.
PNAS-2001-Frye-373-8.pdf	Negative regulation of defense responses in plants by a conserved MAPKK kinase	2001	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405-3700, USA.	The enhanced disease resistance 1 (edr1) mutation of Arabidopsis confers resistance to powdery mildew disease caused by the fungus Erysiphe cichoracearum. Resistance mediated by the edr1 mutation is correlated with induction of several defense responses, including host cell death. Double mutant analysis revealed that all edr1-associated phenotypes are suppressed by mutations that block salicylic acid (SA) perception (nim1) or reduce SA production (pad4 and eds1). The NahG transgene, which lowers endogenous SA levels, also suppressed edr1. In contrast, the ein2 mutation did not suppress edr1-mediated resistance and associated phenotypes, indicating that ethylene and jasmonic acid-induced responses are not required for edr1 resistance. The EDR1 gene was isolated by positional cloning and was found to encode a putative MAP kinase kinase kinase similar to CTR1, a negative regulator of ethylene responses in Arabidopsis. Taken together, these data suggest that EDR1 functions at the top of a MAP kinase cascade that negatively regulates SA-inducible defense responses. Putative orthologs of EDR1 are present in monocots such as rice and barley, indicating that EDR1 may regulate defense responses in a wide range of crop species.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs10059-009-0161-5.pdf	Rice OsACDR1 (Oryza sativa accelerated cell death and resistance 1) is a potential positive regulator of fungal disease resistance	2009	Mol Cells	Department of Molecular Biology, College of Natural Science, Sejong University, Seoul 143-747, Korea.	Rice Oryza sativa accelerated cell death and resistance 1 (OsACDR1) encodes a putative Raf-like mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK). We had previously reported upregulation of the OsACDR1 transcript by a range of environmental stimuli involved in eliciting defense-related pathways. Here we apply biochemical, gain and loss-of-function approaches to characterize OsACDR1 function in rice. The OsACDR1 protein showed autophosphorylation and possessed kinase activity. Rice plants overexpressing OsACDR1 exhibited spontaneous hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions on leaves, upregulation of defense-related marker genes and accumulation of phenolic compounds and secondary metabolites (phytoalexins). These transgenic plants also acquired enhanced resistance to a fungal pathogen (Magnaporthe grisea) and showed inhibition of appressorial penetration on the leaf surface. In contrast, loss-offunction and RNA silenced OsACDR1 rice mutant plants showed downregulation of defense-related marker genes expressions and susceptibility to M. grisea. Furthermore, transient expression of an OsACDR1:GFP fusion protein in rice protoplast and onion epidermal cells revealed its localization to the nucleus. These results indicate that OsACDR1 plays an important role in the positive regulation of disease resistance in rice.
NA	Mutation of SPOTTED LEAF3 (SPL3) impairs abscisic acid-responsive signalling and delays leaf senescence in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, and Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-921, Korea.	Lesion mimic mutants commonly display spontaneous cell death in pre-senescent green leaves under normal conditions, without pathogen attack. Despite molecular and phenotypic characterization of several lesion mimic mutants, the mechanisms of the spontaneous formation of cell death lesions remain largely unknown. Here, the rice lesion mimic mutant spotted leaf3 (spl3) was examined. When grown under a light/dark cycle, the spl3 mutant appeared similar to wild-type at early developmental stages, but lesions gradually appeared in the mature leaves close to heading stage. By contrast, in spl3 mutants grown under continuous light, severe cell death lesions formed in developing leaves, even at the seedling stage. Histochemical analysis showed that hydrogen peroxide accumulated in the mutant, likely causing the cell death phenotype. By map-based cloning and complementation, it was shown that a 1-bp deletion in the first exon of Oryza sativa Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase1 (OsMAPKKK1)/OsEDR1/OsACDR1 causes the spl3 mutant phenotype. The spl3 mutant was found to be insensitive to abscisic acid (ABA), showing normal root growth in ABA-containing media and delayed leaf yellowing during dark-induced and natural senescence. Expression of ABA signalling-associated genes was also less responsive to ABA treatment in the mutant. Furthermore, the spl3 mutant had lower transcript levels and activities of catalases, which scavenge hydrogen peroxide, probably due to impairment of ABA-responsive signalling. Finally, a possible molecular mechanism of lesion formation in the mature leaves of spl3 mutant is discussed.
NA	Genetic analysis and identification of candidate genes for two spotted-leaf mutants (spl101 and spl102) in rice.	2017	Yi Chuan	1. Hainan Key Laboratory for Sustainable Utilization of Tropical Bioresources and Agricultural College of Hainan University, Haikou 570228, China; 2. State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Spotted-leaf mutants form spots in leaves or leaf sheaths under normal condition. The spotted-leaf phenotypes are similar to hypersensitive reaction of plants attacked by pathogen. Identification and characterization of the spotted-leaf mutants are helpful for understanding the mechanisms of resistance to plant diseases. Here, we identify two spotted-leaf mutants spl101 and spl102 from an EMS-treated elite japonica cultivar KYJ (Kuanyejing). spl101 and spl102 form serious spots at the late heading stage. Genetic analyses show that the spotted-leaf phenotypes of both spl101 and spl102 are caused by a single recessive mutation, respectively. By employing the Mutmap method, we reveal that both spl101 and spl102 contain mutations in the OsEDR1 gene. The spl101 mutation occurs in the 5бу-splicing site of the 6(th) intron of OsEDR1, which causes abnormal recognition of the 6(th) intron and leads to the frameshift mutation. The spl102 mutant contains a mutation in the tenth exon of OsEDR1, resulting in an amino acid change from the phenylalanine (F) to the cysteine (C). OsEDR1 has been reported to regulate pathogen-resistant reaction, and loss of OsEDR1 function produces similar phenotypes to those of spl101 and spl102. Here, two newly identified alleles of OsEDR1 will be benefit for further understanding the molecular mechanisms of the OsEDR1 gene in disease resistance, and will be helpful for enriching the rice germplasm resources. In addition, our results also validate the effectiveness of the Mutmap method in cloning the candidate mutations.
NA	Pathogen-inducible OsMPKK10.2-OsMPK6 cascade phosphorylates the Raf-like kinase OsEDR1 and inhibits its scaffold function to promote rice disease resistance	2021	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China. Electronic address: mhg@mail.hzau.edu.cn.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades regulate a myriad of plant biological processes, including disease resistance. Plant genomes encode a large number of MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) that can be divided into two subfamilies, namely MEKK-like kinases and Raf-like kinases. Thus far, the functions of MEKK-like MAPKKKs have been relatively well characterized, but the roles of Raf-like MAPKKKs in plant MAPK cascades remain less understood. Here, we report the role of OsEDR1, a Raf-like MAPKKK, in the regulation of the MAPK cascade in rice response to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc). We found that OsEDR1 inhibits OsMPKK10.2 (a MAPK kinase) activity through physical interaction. Upon Xoc infection, OsMPKK10.2 is phosphorylated at S304 to activate OsMPK6 (a MAPK). Interestingly, activated OsMPK6 phosphorylates OsEDR1 at S861, which destabilizes OsEDR1 and thus releases the inhibition of OsMPKK10.2, leading to increased OsMPKK10.2 activity and enhanced resistance of rice plants to Xoc. Taken together, these results provide new insights into the functions of Raf-like kinases in the regulation of the MAPK cascade in plant immunity.
