REP-1|OsEP3A|OsSAG12-1	seedling	Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice	In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings
REP-1|OsEP3A|OsSAG12-1	gibberellin	Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds	The expression of the gene for REP-1 (Rep1) is induced by gibberellins (GAs) and repressed by abscisic acid (ABA)
REP-1|OsEP3A|OsSAG12-1	seed	Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice	In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings
REP-1|OsEP3A|OsSAG12-1	seed	Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice	An OsEP3A-specific DNA probe was used to study the effect of various factors on the expression of OsEP3A in germinating seeds and vegetative tissues of rice
REP-1|OsEP3A|OsSAG12-1	seed	Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice	The expression of OsEP3A is hormonally regulated in germinating seeds, spatially and temporally regulated in vegetative tissues, and nitrogen-regulated in suspension-cultured cells
