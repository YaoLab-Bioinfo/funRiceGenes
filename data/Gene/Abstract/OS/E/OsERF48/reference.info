NA	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	Graduate School of International Agricultural Technology and Crop Biotechnology Institute/GreenBio Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Pyeongchang, 25354, Korea.	The AP2/ERF family is a plant-specific transcription factor (TF) family whose members have been associated with various developmental processes and stress tolerance. Here, we functionally characterized the drought-inducible OsERF48, a group Ib member of the rice ERF family with four conserved motifs, CMI-1, -2, -3 and -4. A transactivation assay in yeast revealed that the C-terminal CMI-1 motif was essential for OsERF48 transcriptional activity. When OsERF48 was overexpressed in an either a root-specific (ROX(OsERF48) ) or whole-body (OX(OsERF48) ) manner, transgenic plants showed a longer and denser root phenotype compared to the nontransgenic (NT) controls. When plants were grown on a 40% polyethylene glycol (PEG)-infused medium under in vitro drought conditions, ROX(OsERF48) plants showed a more vigorous root growth than OX(OsERF48) and NT plants. In addition, the ROX(OsERF48) plants exhibited higher grain yield than OX(OsERF48) and NT plants under field-drought conditions. We constructed a putative OsERF48 regulatory network by cross-referencing ROX(OsERF48) root-specific RNA-seq data with a co-expression network database, from which we inferred the involvement of 20 drought-related genes in OsERF48-mediated responses. These included genes annotated as being involved in stress signaling, carbohydrate metabolism, cell-wall proteins, and drought-responses. They included, OsCML16, a key gene in calcium signaling during abiotic stress, which was shown to be a direct target of OsERF48 by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR analysis and a transient protoplast expression assay. Our results demonstrated that OsERF48 regulates OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhance root growth and drought tolerance. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	Comparative transcriptome and metabolome profiling reveal molecular mechanisms underlying OsDRAP1-mediated salt tolerance in rice	2021	Sci Rep	Institute of Crop Sciences/National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, South Zhong-Guan-Cun Street 12#, Beijing, 100081, China.	Integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics data can provide detailed information for better understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying salt tolerance in rice. In the present study, we report a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome of rice overexpressing the OsDRAP1 gene, which encodes an ERF transcription factor and was previously identified to be conferring drought tolerance. Phenotypic analysis showed that OsDRAP1 overexpression (OE) improved salt tolerance by increasing the survival rate under salt stress. OsDRAP1 affected the physiological indices such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) to enhance redox homeostasis and membrane stability in response to salt stress. Higher basal expression of OsDRAP1 resulted in differential expression of genes that potentially function in intrinsic salt tolerance. A core set of genes with distinct functions in transcriptional regulation, organelle gene expression and ion transport were substantially up-regulated in the OE line in response to salt stress, implying their important role in OsDRAP1-mediated salt tolerance. Correspondingly, metabolome profiling detected a number of differentially metabolites in the OE line relative to the wild type under salt stress. These metabolites, including amino acids (proline, valine), organic acids (glyceric acid, phosphoenolpyruvic acid and ascorbic acid) and many secondary metabolites, accumulated to higher levels in the OE line, demonstrating their role in salt tolerance. Integration of transcriptome and metabolome analysis highlights the crucial role of amino acids and carbohydrate metabolism pathways in OsDRAP1-mediated salt tolerance.
