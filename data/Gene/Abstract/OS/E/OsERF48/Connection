OsCML16	OsERF48|OsDRAP1	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance
OsCML16	OsERF48|OsDRAP1	Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance	Our results demonstrated that OsERF48 regulates OsCML16, a calmodulin-like protein gene that  enhance root growth and drought tolerance.
