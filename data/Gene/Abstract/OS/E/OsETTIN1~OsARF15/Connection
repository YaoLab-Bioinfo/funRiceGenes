OsETT2|OsETTIN2	OsETTIN1|OsARF15	Rice LHS1/OsMADS1 controls floret meristem specification by coordinated regulation of transcription factors and hormone signaling pathways	We found that the OsMADS1 targets OsETTIN1 and OsETTIN2 redundantly ensure carpel differentiation
OsETTIN1|OsARF15	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	Rice LHS1/OsMADS1 controls floret meristem specification by coordinated regulation of transcription factors and hormone signaling pathways	We found that the OsMADS1 targets OsETTIN1 and OsETTIN2 redundantly ensure carpel differentiation
OsETTIN1|OsARF15	OsPID|OsPINOID	OsPINOID Regulates Stigma and Ovule Initiation through Maintenance of the Floral Meristem by Auxin Signaling.	 Furthermore, the expression of most auxin response factor (ARF) genes was down-regulated, and OsETTIN1, OsETTIN2 and OsMONOPTEROS lost their rearrangements of expression patterns during pistil and stamen primordia development in ospid
