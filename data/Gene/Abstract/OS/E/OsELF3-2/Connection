APIP6	OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	OsELF3-2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis ELF3, interacts with the E3 ligase APIP6 and negatively regulates immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice	OsELF3-2 interacts with APIP6 and negatively regulates basal resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae.

Hd17|Ef7|OsELF3-1|OsELF3.1|OsELF3	OsEF3|OsELF3-2|OsELF3.2	Genetic relationship between phytochromes and OsELF3-1 reveals the mode of regulation for the suppression of phytochrome signaling in rice.	 A comparison between the oself3-1 mutant and transgenic rice lines in which OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2 are simultaneously silenced uncovered a role for OsELF3-1 in addition to the canonical ELF3 function as an evolutionarily conserved role for a nighttime repressor that regulates the rice circadian clock
