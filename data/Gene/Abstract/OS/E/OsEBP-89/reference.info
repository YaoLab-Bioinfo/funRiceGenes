The AP2/EREBP transcription factors play important roles in plant development and in the responses of plants to biotic and abiotic stresses. All members of the EREBP subfamily described to date are from dicotyledonous plants. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of a rice gene, OsEBP-89, encoding a protein 326 amino acids long with a typical EREBP domain; this is the first report of an EREBP transcription factor in a monocotyledonous plant. Except for the EREBP domain, the OsEBP-89 protein does not have substantial sequence similarities to other members of the subfamily. The DNA-binding activity of the EREBP domain was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. An activation domain rich in acidic amino acids was identified by using a yeast one-hybrid system. Two putative nuclear-localization signals were also identified. The results of northern blot hybridization experiments showed that the transcript of the OsEBP-89 gene accumulates primarily in immature seeds, roots, and leaves (low levels). More detailed information about the pattern of OsEBP-89 gene expression was obtained by histochemical studies of transgenic rice plants carrying an OsEBP-89 5'/GUS reporter gene. The reporter gene was expressed in the endosperm starting at 7 days after pollination and in the intercalary meristem of plants. Expression of OsEBP-89 was induced in roots of rice seedlings by treatment with ACC, NaCl, or 2,4-D. Two cis-acting elements, an endosperm motif and a primary PERE, are present upstream of the OsEBP-89 coding region and may be involved in regulating its expression. Collectively, these results suggest that the OsEBP-89 gene is a new member of the EREBP subfamily and may be involved in ethylene-dependent seed maturation and shoot development of rice.

OsEBP-89 gene encodes an ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa). Northern blot analysis revealed that OsEBP-89 was expressed in root, stem, seeds, flowers and leaves of rice. Histochemical assay showed that GUS expressed mainly in phloem of vascular tissues of the root and stem transition region (RST), basal part of sheath roots, stem node and basal part of adventitious roots, also in endosperm of seeds in transgenic rice harboring OsEBP-89/GUS construct (pNSG). A sequence of region from C279 to C97 was found to play an important role for OsEBP-89 genes expression though promoter deletion assay. The possible function of OsEBP-89 gene was discussed.
NA	An APETALA2/ethylene responsive factor, OsEBP89 knockout enhances adaptation to direct-seeding on wet land and tolerance to drought stress in rice.	2020	Mol Genet Genomics	College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Water stress is the most important adverse factor limiting rice production. Too much water leads to flood and too little leads to drought. Floods and droughts can severely damage crop at different times of the rice life cycle. So the research on submergence tolerance and drought resistance of rice is particularly urgent. In this study, we reported that OsEBP89 (Oryza sativa Ethylene-responsive element binding protein, clone 89), a member of the AP2/ERF subfamily, is involved in a novel signal transduction associated with the tolerance to drought and submergence stress. OsEBP89 was found to be strongly inhibited by drought stress and promoted by submergence. The OsEBP89 protein was located at the nucleus in the rice protoplast. Loss of OsEBP89 was found to improve the seed germination under submerged conditions and also enhanced the tolerance to drought stress throughout growth stage. Additionally, OsEBP89 knockout rice plants increased the accumulation of proline, improved the ability to scavenge ROS compared to overexpression lines and wild type after PEG treatment. Transcriptome data indicates that knockout of OsEBP89 improved the expression of specific genes in response to adverse factors, such as OsAPX1, OsHsfA3, and OsP5CS. Further results indicate that OsEBP89 can interact with and be phosphorylated by SnRK1¦Á (sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1 gene). These findings provide insight into the mechanism of abiotic stress tolerance, and suggest OsEBP89 as a new genetic engineering resource to improve abiotic stress tolerance in rice.
