OsExo70-F3|OsExo70F3	immunity	Rice Exo70 interacts with a fungal effector, AVR-Pii and is required for AVR-Pii-triggered immunity.	AVR-Pii interaction with OsExo70-F3 seems to play a crucial role in effector triggered immunity by Pii, suggesting the role of OsExo70 as decoy or helper in Pii/AVR-Pii interactions
