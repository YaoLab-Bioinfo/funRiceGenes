DWF1|DIM;DWF1|DIM	OsGSR1|GW6	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that OsGSR1 interacts with DIM/DWF1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion from 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol in BR biosynthesis
OsGSR1|GW6	sd1|GA20ox2	OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice	Furthermore, OsGSR1 RNAi plants show a reduced sensitivity to GA treatment, an increased expression of the GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2, which is feedback inhibited by GA signaling, and an elevated level of endogenous GA: together, these suggest that OsGSR1 is a positive regulator of GA signaling
