These results demonstrate that qGL3 suppresses BR signaling by regulating the phosphorylation and stability of OsGSK3, which modulates OsBZR1 phosphorylation and subcellular distribution
OsBZR1	OsGSK3	Rice qGL3/OsPPKL1 Functions with the GSK3/SHAGGY-Like Kinase OsGSK3 to Modulate Brassinosteroid Signaling.	 Knocking-out of OsGSK3 enhances BR signaling and induces nuclear localization of Oryza sativa BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 (OsBZR1)
