cr200828a.pdf	Gibberellin homeostasis and plant height control by EUI and a role for gibberellin in root gravity responses in rice	2008	Cell Res	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China.	The rice Eui (ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE) gene encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that deactivates bioactive gibberellins (GAs). In this study, we investigated controlled expression of the Eui gene and its role in plant development. We found that Eui was differentially induced by exogenous GAs and that the Eui promoter had the highest activity in the vascular bundles. The eui mutant was defective in starch granule development in root caps and Eui overexpression enhanced starch granule generation and gravity responses, revealing a role for GA in root starch granule development and gravity responses. Experiments using embryoless half-seeds revealed that RAmy1A and GAmyb were highly upregulated in eui aleurone cells in the absence of exogenous GA. In addition, the GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox1 and GA20ox2 were downregulated and GA2ox1 was upregulated in eui seedlings. These results indicate that EUI is involved in GA homeostasis, not only in the internodes at the heading stage, but also in the seedling stage, roots and seeds. Disturbing GA homeostasis affected the expression of the GA signaling genes GID1 (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1), GID2 and SLR1. Transgenic RNA interference of the Eui gene effectively increased plant height and improved heading performance. By contrast, the ectopic expression of Eui under the promoters of the rice GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2 significantly reduced plant height. These results demonstrate that a slight increase in Eui expression could dramatically change rice morphology, indicating the practical application of the Eui gene in rice molecular breeding for a high yield potential.
PNAS-2001-Itoh-8909-14.pdf	Cloning and functional analysis of two gibberellin 3 beta -hydroxylase genes that are differently expressed during the growth of rice	2001	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Bioscience Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya, 464-8601, Japan.	We have cloned two gibberellin (GA) 3 beta-hydroxylase genes, OsGA3ox1 and OsGA3ox2, from rice by screening a genomic library with a DNA fragment obtained by PCR using degenerate primers. We have used full-scan GC-MS and Kovats retention indices to show function for the two encoded recombinant fusion proteins. Both proteins show 3 beta-hydroxylase activity for the steps GA(20) to GA(1), GA(5) to GA(3), GA(44) to GA(38), and GA(9) to GA(4). In addition, indirect evidence suggests that the OsGA3ox1 protein also has 2,3-desaturase activity, which catalyzes the steps GA(9) to 2,3-dehydro-GA(9) and GA(20) to GA(5) (2,3-dehydro GA(20)), and 2 beta-hydroxylase activity, which catalyzes the steps GA(1) to GA(8) and GA(4) to GA(34). Molecular and linkage analysis maps the OsGA3ox1 gene to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 5; the OsGA3ox2 gene maps to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 1 that corresponds to the D18 locus. The association of the OsGA3ox2 gene with the d18 locus is confirmed by sequence and complementation analysis of three d18 alleles. Complementation of the d18-AD allele with the OxGA3ox2 gene results in transgenic plants with a normal phenotype. Although both genes show transient expression, the highest level for OsGA3ox1 is from unopened flower. The highest level for OsGA3ox2 is from elongating leaves.
NA	Evolutionary alterations in gene expression and enzymatic activities of gibberellin 3-oxidase 1 in Oryza.	2022	Commun Biol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya, 464-8601, Japan.	Proper anther and pollen development are important for plant reproduction. The plant hormone gibberellin is important for anther development in rice, but its gametophytic functions remain largely unknown. Here, we report the functional and evolutionary analyses of rice gibberellin 3-oxidase 1 (OsGA3ox1), a gibberellin synthetic enzyme specifically expressed in the late developmental stages of anthers. Enzymatic and X-ray crystallography analyses reveal that OsGA3ox1 has a higher GA(7) synthesis ratio than OsGA3ox2. In addition, we generate an osga3ox1 knockout mutant by genome editing and demonstrate the bioactive gibberellic acid synthesis by the OsGA3ox1 action during starch accumulation in pollen via invertase regulation. Furthermore, we analyze the evolution of Oryza GA3ox1s and reveal that their enzyme activity and gene expression have evolved in a way that is characteristic of the Oryza genus and contribute to their male reproduction ability.
