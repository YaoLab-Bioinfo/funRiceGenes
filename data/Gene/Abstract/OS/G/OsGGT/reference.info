A submergence-induced gene, OsGGT, was cloned from 7-day submerged rice (Oryza sativa L. plants, FR13A (a submergence-tolerant cultivar, Indica), using suppression subtractive hybridization and both 5'- and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length OsGGT cDNA contains 1,273 bp with an open reading frame of 1,140 bp (17-1,156) that encodes 379 amino acids. Its deduced amino acid sequence is homologous with glycogenin glucosyltransferase. We found that the OsGGT gene is located in the 17,970-20,077 bp region of genome fragment AAAA01002475.1 of the Indica cultivar and in the 53,293-51,186 bp region of genome fragment AC037426.12 of chromosome 10 of the Japanica cultivar. A time-course study showed that OsGGT-gene expression increased in FR13A during submergence but decreased in IR42 (submergence-intolerant cultivar, Indica). The expression of the OsGGT gene in FR13A was induced by salicylic acid and benzyladenine. The accumulation of OsGGT mRNA in FR13A also increased in response to ethylene, gibberellin, abscisic acid, drought and salt treatment, but methyl jasmonate treatment and cold stress had no effect on expression. These results suggest that the OsGGT gene could be related to submergence stress and associated with a general defensive response to various environmental stresses.
