OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	sd1|GA20ox2	A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice	This result indicates that not only OsGA20ox2 but also OsGA20ox1 affects plant stature
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism	Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
GD1	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism	Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
NAL1|qFLW4	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.
NAL1|qFLW4	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	 Although the NAL1 and GNP1 genes regulating the rice GNP and grain yield have been cloned, their allelic diversity, functional differences in rice germplasms, and effects of their combination on GNP and grain yield remain unclear
NAL1|qFLW4	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	Based on DNA sequences of these two genes in 198 cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and 8-10 wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) germplasms, 16 and 14 haplotypes were identified for NAL1 and GNP1, respectively
NAL1|qFLW4	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	 Compared with the transgenic lines with GNP1 or NAL1, the transgenic lines with both genes had a higher GNP (15
NAL1|qFLW4	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	Our results indicated that the GNP1 and NAL1 exhibited obvious differentiation and their combinations can significantly increase the grain yield in geng rice cultivars
NAL1|qFLW4	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	 These observations provide insights into the molecular basis of the GNP and may be useful for rice breeding of high yield potential by pyramiding GNP1 and NAL1
OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	OsSWEET3a	The dual function of OsSWEET3a as a gibberellin and glucose transporter is important for young shoot development in rice	 OsSWEET3a expression co-localized with OsGA20ox1 expression in the vascular bundles but not with OsGA3ox2, whose expression was restricted to leaf primordia and young leaves
