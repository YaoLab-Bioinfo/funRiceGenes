OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	 ga 	A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice	Analysis of mRNA and the endogenous GAs reveal that biologically active GA level is increased by up-regulation of the OsGA20ox1 gene in B142
OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	gibberellin	OsGA20ox1, a candidate gene for a major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice	Within this mapped region, we identified the gene OsGA20ox1, which is related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis
OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	dwarf	The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism	Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	seedling	OsGA20ox1, a candidate gene for a major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice	These results indicate that OsGA20ox1 is a strong candidate gene for major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice

OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	cytokinin	The QTL GNP1 Encodes GA20ox1, Which Increases Grain Number and Yield by Increasing Cytokinin Activity in Rice Panicle Meristems.	We propose that cytokinin activity increased due to a KNOX-mediated transcriptional feedback loop resulting from the higher GNP1 transcript levels, in turn leading to increased expression of the GA catabolism genes GA2oxs and reduced GA1 and GA3 accumulation
OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	inflorescence	The QTL GNP1 Encodes GA20ox1, Which Increases Grain Number and Yield by Increasing Cytokinin Activity in Rice Panicle Meristems.	Sequence variations in its promoter region increased the levels of GNP1 transcripts, which were enriched in the apical regions of inflorescence meristems in NIL-GNP1TQ
