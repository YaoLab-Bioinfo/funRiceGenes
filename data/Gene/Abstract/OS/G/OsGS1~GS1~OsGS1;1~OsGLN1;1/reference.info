KEY MESSAGE : The regulation of GS isoforms by WD was organ specific. Two GS isoforms i.e. OsGS1;1 and OsGS2 were differentially regulated in IR-64 (drought-sensitive) and Khitish (drought-tolerant) cultivars of rice. Water deficit (WD) has adverse effect on rice (Oryza sativa L.) and acclimation requires essential reactions of primary metabolism to continue. Rice plants utilize ammonium as major nitrogen source, which is assimilated into glutamine by the reaction of Glutamine synthetase (GS, EC 6.3.1.2). Rice plants possess one gene (OsGS2) for chloroplastic GS2 and three genes (OsGS1;1, OsGS1;2 and OsGS1;3) for cytosolic GS1. Here, we report the effect of WD on regulation of GS isoforms in drought-sensitive (cv. IR-64) and drought-tolerant (cv. Khitish) rice cultivars. Under WD, total GS activity in root and leaf decreased significantly in IR-64 seedlings in comparison to Khitish seedlings. The reduced GS activity in IR-64 leaf was mainly due to decrease in GS2 activity, which correlated with decrease in corresponding transcript and polypeptide contents. GS1 transcript and polypeptide accumulated in leaf during WD, however, GS1 activity was maintained at a constant level. Total GS activity in stem of both the varieties was insensitive to WD. Among GS1 genes, OsGS1;1 expression was differently regulated by WD in the two rice varieties. Its transcript accumulated more abundantly in IR-64 leaf than in Khitish leaf. Following WD, OsGS1;1 mRNA level in stem and root tissues declined in IR-64 and enhanced in Khitish. A steady OsGS1;2 expression patterns were noted in leaf, stem and root of both the cultivars. Results suggest that OsGS2 and OsGS1;1 expression may contribute to drought tolerance of Khitish cultivar under WD conditions.
Gaur-2012-Influence of differe.pdf	Influence of different nitrogen inputs on the members of ammonium transporter and glutamine synthetase genes in two rice genotypes having differential responsiveness to nitrogen	2012	Mol Biol Rep	Department of Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering, College of Basic Sciences and Humanities, G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar, Uttarakhand, India.	Two aromatic rice genotypes, Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1) and Kalanamak 3119 (KN3119) having 120 and 30 kg/ha optimum nitrogen requirement respectively, to produce optimal yield, were chosen to understand their differential nitrogen responsiveness. Both the genotypes grown under increasing nitrogen inputs showed differences in seed/panicle, 1,000 seed weight, %nitrogen in the biomass and protein content in the seeds. All these parameters in PB1 were found to be in the increasing order in contrast to KN3119 which showed declined response on increasing nitrogen dose exceeding the normal dose indicating that both the genotypes respond differentially to the nitrogen inputs. Gene expression analysis of members of ammonium transporter gene family in flag leaves during active grain filling stage revealed that all the three members of OsAMT3 family genes (OsAMT1;1-3), only one member of OsAMT2 family i.e., OsAMT2;3 and the high affinity OsAMT1;1 were differentially expressed and were affected by different doses of nitrogen. In both the genotypes, both increase and decline in seed protein contents matched with the expressions levels of OsAMT1;1, OsGS1;1 and OsGS1;2 in the flag leaves during grain filling stage indicating that high nitrogen nutrition in KN3119 probably causes the repression of these genes which might be important during grain filling.
Ishiyama-2004-Biochemical backgrou.pdf	Biochemical background and compartmentalized functions of cytosolic glutamine synthetase for active ammonium assimilation in rice roots	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	RIKEN Plant Science Center, 1-7-22 Suehiro, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, 230-0045 Japan.	Rice plants in paddy fields prefer to utilize ammonium as a major nitrogen source. Glutamine synthetase (GS) serves for assimilation of ammonium in rice root, and ameliorates the toxic effect of ammonium excess. Among the three isoenzymes of the cytosolic GS1 gene family in rice, OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 were abundantly expressed in roots. Analysis of the purified enzymes showed that OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 can be classified into high-affinity subtypes with relatively high V(max) values, as compared with the major high-affinity isoenzyme, GLN1;1, in Arabidopsis. Low-affinity forms of GS1 comparable to those in Arabidopsis (GLN1;2 and GLN1;3) were absent in rice roots. The OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 transcripts showed reciprocal responses to ammonium supply in the surface cell layers of roots. OsGLN1;1 accumulated in dermatogen, epidermis and exodermis under nitrogen-limited condition. By contrast, OsGLN1;2 was abundantly expressed in the same cell layers under nitrogen-sufficient conditions, replenishing the loss of OsGLN1;1 following ammonium treatment. Within the central cylinder of elongating zone, OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 were both induced by ammonium, which was distinguishable from the response observed in the surface cell layers. The high-capacity Gln synthetic activities of OsGLN1;1 and OsGLN1;2 facilitate active ammonium assimilation in specific cell types in rice roots.
J. Exp. Bot.-2001-Obara-1209-17.pdf	Mapping of QTLs associated with cytosolic glutamine synthetase and NADH-glutamate synthase in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2001	J Exp Bot	Department of Applied Plant Science, Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Tohoku University, 1-1 Tsutsumidori‚ÄêAmamiyamachi, Aoba‚Äêku, Sendai 981-8555, Japan	Ninety‚Äêeight backcross inbred lines (BC1F6) developed between Nipponbare, a japonica rice, and Kasalath, an indica rice were employed to detect putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the contents of cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1; EC 6.3.1.2) and NADH‚Äêglutamate synthase (NADH‚ÄêGOGAT; EC 1.4.1.14) in leaves. Immunoblotting analyses showed transgressive segregations toward lower or greater contents of these enzyme proteins in these backcross inbred lines. Seven chromosomal QTL regions for GS1 protein content and six for NADH‚ÄêGOGAT protein content were detected. Some of these QTLs were located in QTL regions for various biochemical and physiological traits affected by nitrogen recycling. These findings suggested that the variation in GS1 and NADH‚ÄêGOGAT protein contents in this population is related to the changes in the rate of nitrogen recycling from senescing organs to developing organs, leading to changes in these physiological traits. Furthermore, a structural gene for GS1 was mapped between two RFLP markers, C560 and C1408, on chromosome 2 and co‚Äêlocated in the QTL region for one‚Äêspikelet weight. A QTL region for NADH‚ÄêGOGAT protein content was detected at the position mapped for the NADH‚ÄêGOGAT structural gene on chromosome 1. A QTL region for soluble protein content in developing leaves was also detected in this region. Although fine mapping is required to identify individual genes in the future, QTL analysis could be a useful post‚Äêgenomic tool to study the gene functions for regulation of nitrogen recycling in rice.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants possess three homologous but distinct genes for cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1): these are OsGS1;1, OsGS1;2, and OsGS1;3. OsGS1;1 was expressed in all organs tested with higher expression in leaf blades, while OsGS1;2, and OsGS1;3 were expressed mainly in roots and spikelets, respectively. We characterized knockout mutants caused by insertion of endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 into the exon-8 (lines ND8037 and ND9801) or the exon-10 (line NC2327) of OsGS1;1. Mendelian segregation occurred in each progeny. Homozygously inserted mutants showed severe retardation in growth rate and grain filling when grown at normal nitrogen concentrations. Abnormal mRNA for GS1;1 was transcribed, and the GS1 protein and its activity in the leaf blades were barely detectable in these mutants. The glutamine pool in the roots and leaf blades of the mutants was lower than that of the wild type. Re-introduction of OsGS1;1 cDNA under the control of its own promoter into the mutants successfully complemented these phenotypes. Progeny where Tos17 was heterozygously inserted or deleted during segregation showed normal phenotypes. The results indicate that GS1;1 is important for normal growth and grain filling in rice; GS1;2 and GS1;3 were not able to compensate for GS1;1 function.
j.1365-313X.2011.04506.x.pdf	Metabolomics data reveal a crucial role of cytosolic glutamine synthetase 1;1 in coordinating metabolic balance in rice	2011	Plant J	RIKEN Plant Science Center, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama 230-0045, Japan.	Rice plants grown in paddy fields preferentially use ammonium as a source of inorganic nitrogen. Glutamine synthetase (GS) catalyses the conversion of ammonium to glutamine. Of the three genes encoding cytosolic GS in rice, OsGS1;1 is critical for normal growth and grain filling. However, the basis of its physiological function that may alter the rate of nitrogen assimilation and carbon metabolism within the context of metabolic networks remains unclear. To address this issue, we carried out quantitative comparative analyses between the metabolite profiles of a rice mutant lacking OsGS1;1 and its background wild type (WT). The mutant plants exhibited severe retardation of shoot growth in the presence of ammonium compared with the WT. Overaccumulation of free ammonium in the leaf sheath and roots of the mutant indicated the importance of OsGS1;1 for ammonium assimilation in both organs. The metabolite profiles of the mutant line revealed: (i) an imbalance in levels of sugars, amino acids and metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and (ii) overaccumulation of secondary metabolites, particularly in the roots under a continuous supply of ammonium. Metabolite-to-metabolite correlation analysis revealed the presence of mutant-specific networks between tryptamine and other primary metabolites in the roots. These results demonstrated a crucial function of OsGS1;1 in coordinating the global metabolic network in rice plants grown using ammonium as the nitrogen source.

A quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with the protein content of cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1; EC 6.3.1.2) in senescing leaves, panicle number, and panicle weight was characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L.). A near-isogenic line (NIL), C-22, developed by marker-assisted selection was grown under different nitrogen levels in the greenhouse and in a paddy field. Chromosome 2 of C-22 had an approximately 50-cM segment substituted from the Kasalath (indica) chromosome in a Koshihikari (japonica) genetic background. C-22 showed a 12-37% lower content of GS1 protein in leaf blades than Koshihikari, which was in good agreement with a QTL region positively affected by the japonica chromosome. At an early vegetative stage, C-22 had more active tillers than Koshihikari in the greenhouse. At the reproductive stage, both panicle number and total panicle weight of C-22 were significantly higher than those of Koshihikari, particularly when the plants were grown under a low-nitrogen condition. These traits of C-22 were further confirmed in a paddy field. Thus, tiller development was positively affected by the Kasalath chromosome at an early vegetative stage, which resulted in an increased panicle number and panicle weight at the mature stage in C-22. These data indicate that the target QTL (Pnn1; panicle number 1) is important in the development of tillers and panicles in rice. Linkage analyses for panicle number and ratio of developing tiller formation in the second axil (RDT) revealed that Pnn1 was delimited at the 6.7-cM region.

KEY MESSAGE: Overexpression of OsGS gene modulates oxidative stress response in rice after exposure to cadmium stress. Our results describe the features of transformants with enhanced tolerance to Cd and abiotic stresses. Glutamine synthetase (GS) (EC 6.3.1.2) is an enzyme that plays an essential role in the metabolism of nitrogen by catalyzing the condensation of glutamate and ammonia to form glutamine. Exposure of plants to cadmium (Cd) has been reported to decrease GS activity in maize, pea, bean, and rice. To better understand the function of the GS gene under Cd stress in rice, we constructed a recombinant pART vector carrying the GS gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and OCS terminator and transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens. We then investigated GS overexpressing rice lines at the physiological and molecular levels under Cd toxicity and abiotic stress conditions. We observed a decrease in GS enzyme activity and mRNA expression among transgenic and wild-type plants subjected to Cd stress. The decrease, however, was significantly lower in the wild type than in the transgenic plants. This was further validated by the high GS mRNA expression and enzyme activity in most of the transgenic lines. Moreover, after 10 days of exposure to Cd stress, increase in the glutamine reductase activity and low or no malondialdehyde contents were observed. These results showed that overexpression of the GS gene in rice modulated the expression of enzymes responsible for membrane peroxidation that may result in plant death.
NA	Concurrent Overexpression of OsGS1;1 and OsGS2 Genes in Transgenic Rice (Oryza sativa L.): Impact on Tolerance to Abiotic Stresses.	2018	Front Plant Sci	Crop Improvement Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi, India.	Glutamine synthetase (GS) is a key enzyme involved in the nitrogen metabolism of higher plants. Abiotic stresses have adverse effects on crop production and pose a serious threat to global food security. GS activity and expression is known to be significantly modulated by various abiotic stresses. However, very few transgenic overexpression studies of GS have studied its impact on abiotic stress tolerance. GS is also the target enzyme of the broad spectrum herbicide Glufosinate (active ingredient: phosphinothricin). In this study, we investigated the effect of concurrent overexpression of the rice cytosolic GS1 (OsGS1;1) and chloroplastic GS2 (OsGS2) genes in transgenic rice on its tolerance to abiotic stresses and the herbicide Glufosinate. Our results demonstrate that the co-overexpression of OsGS1;1 and OsGS2 isoforms in transgenic rice plants enhanced its tolerance to osmotic and salinity stress at the seedling stage. The transgenic lines maintained significantly higher fresh weight, chlorophyll content, and relative water content than wild type (wt) and null segregant (ns) controls, under both osmotic and salinity stress. The OsGS1;1/OsGS2 co-overexpressing transgenic plants accumulated higher levels of proline but showed lower electrolyte leakage and had lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content under the stress treatments. The transgenic lines showed considerably enhanced photosynthetic and agronomic performance under drought and salinity stress imposed during the reproductive stage, as compared to wt and ns control plants. The grain filling rates of the transgenic rice plants under reproductive stage drought stress (64.6 °¿ 4.7%) and salinity stress (58.2 °¿ 4.5%) were significantly higher than control plants, thereby leading to higher yields under these abiotic stress conditions. Preliminary analysis also revealed that the transgenic lines had improved tolerance to methyl viologen induced photo-oxidative stress. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the concurrent overexpression of OsGS1;1 and OsGS2 isoforms in rice enhanced physiological tolerance and agronomic performance under adverse abiotic stress conditions, apparently acting through multiple mechanistic routes. The transgenic rice plants also showed limited tolerance to the herbicide Glufosinate. The advantages and limitations of glutamine synthetase overexpression in crop plants, along with future strategies to overcome these limitations for utilization in crop improvement have also been discussed briefly.
NA	Cytosolic GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE 1;1 modulates metabolism and chloroplast development in roots.	2020	Plant Physiol	University of Tsukuba CITY: Tsukuba STATE: Ibaraki Japan [JP] kusano.miyako.fp@u.tsukuba.ac.jp.	Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient and the final form of endogenous inorganic N is ammonium, which is assimilated by glutamine synthetase (GS) into glutamine. However, how the multiple isoforms of cytosolic GSs contribute to metabolic systems via the regulation of ammonium assimilation remains unclear. In the present study, we compared the effects of two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cytosolic GSs, namely OsGS1;1 and OsGS1;2, on central metabolism in roots using reverse genetics, metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling, and network analyses. We observed (i) abnormal sugar and organic N accumulation and (ii) significant upregulation of genes associated with photosynthesis and chlorophyll biosynthesis in the roots of Osgs1;1 but not Osgs1;2 knockout mutants. Network analysis of the Osgs1;1 mutant suggested that metabolism of glutamine was coordinated with the metabolic modules of sugar metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and carbon (C) fixation. Transcript profiling of Osgs1;1 mutant roots revealed that expression of the rice sigma-factor (OsSIG) genes in the mutants were transiently upregulated. GOLDEN2-LIKE transcription factor-encoding genes, which are involved in chloroplast biogenesis in rice, could not compensate for the lack of OsSIGs in the Osgs1;1 mutant. Microscopic analysis revealed mature chloroplast development in Osgs1;1 roots but not in the roots of Osgs1;2, Osgs1;2-complemented lines, or the wildtype. Thus, organic N assimilated by OsGS1;1 affects a broad range of metabolites and transcripts involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and plastid development in rice roots, whereas OsGS1;2 has a more specific role, affecting mainly amino acid homeostasis but not C metabolism.
NA	The Amino Acid Transporter OsAAP4 Contributes to Rice Tillering and Grain Yield by Regulating Neutral Amino Acid Allocation through Two Splicing Variants	2021	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region (Ministry of Education), College of Agricultural Sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China. zmfang@gzu.edu.cn.	Background: Amino acids, which are transported by amino acid transporters, are the major forms of organic nitrogen utilized by higher plants. Among the 19 Amino Acid Permease transporters (AAPs) in rice, only a small number of these genes have been reported to influence rice growth and development. However, whether other OsAAPs are responsible for rice growth and development is unclear.  Results: In this study, we demonstrate that OsAAP4 promoter sequences are divergent between Indica and Japonica, with higher expression in the former, which produces more tillers and higher grain yield than does Japonica. Overexpression of two different splicing variants of OsAAP4 in Japonica ZH11 significantly increased rice tillering and grain yield as result of enhancing the neutral amino acid concentrations of Val, Pro, Thr and Leu. OsAAP4 RNA interference (RNAi) and mutant lines displayed opposite trends compared with overexpresing (OE) lines. In addition, exogenous Val or Pro at 0.5 mM significantly promoted the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing an OsAAP4a splicing variant compared with ZH11, and exogenous Val or Pro at 2.0 mM significantly enhanced the bud outgrowth of lines overexpressing splicing variant OsAAP4b compared with ZH11. Of note, the results of a protoplast amino acid-uptake assay showed that Val or Pro at different concentrations was specifically transported and accumulated in these overexpressing lines. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that OsAAP4 may affect nitrogen transport and metabolism, and auxin, cytokinin signaling in regulating rice tillering.  Conclusion: Our results suggested that OsAAP4 contributes to rice tiller and grain yield by regulating neutral amino acid allocation through two different splicing variants and that OsAAP4 might have potential applications in rice breeding.
