OsGRF3	OSH71|Oskn2	Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.	A yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) one-hybrid screen with the upstream sequence of the KNOX gene Oskn2 from rice (Oryza sativa) resulted in isolation of OsGRF3 and OsGRF10
OsGRF3	OSH71|Oskn2	Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.	These effects were associated with down-regulation of endogenous Oskn2 expression by OsGRF3
OsGRF3	OSH71|Oskn2	Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.	Conversely, RNA interference silencing of OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF5 resulted in dwarfism, delayed growth and inflorescence formation, and up-regulation of Oskn2
OsbHLH35	OsGRF3	Tightly controlled expression of OsbHLH35 is critical for anther development in rice	 Yeast one-hybrid screening identified three members of the Growth-Regulating Factor (GRF) family, OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF11, as transcriptional regulators of OsbHLH35
OsGRF11	OsGRF3	Tightly controlled expression of OsbHLH35 is critical for anther development in rice	 Yeast one-hybrid screening identified three members of the Growth-Regulating Factor (GRF) family, OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF11, as transcriptional regulators of OsbHLH35
