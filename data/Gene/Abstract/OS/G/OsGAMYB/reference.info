10.1007-s11103-010-9687-3.pdf	A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice	2010	Plant Mol Biol	Crop Biotech Institute & Department of Plant Molecular Systems Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, 446-701, Republic of Korea.	Seed germination is an important character for plant growth and seed quality. We identified a rice mutant that was delayed in its germination. There, T-DNA was inserted into Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), causing a recessive null mutation. Overexpression of the gene enhanced seed germination. OsDSG1 is most similar to Arabidopsis AIP2, an E3 ligase targeting ABI3.Yeast two-hybrid experiments showed that our OsDSG1 binds to OsABI3, indicating that OsDSG1 is a rice ortholog of AIP2. Self-ubiquitination assay indicated that bacterially expressed OsDSG1 protein has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsDSG1 was expressed in leaves and roots, and strongly in developing seeds. In addition to the delayed-germination phenotype, mutant plants were shorter and had greater tolerance to high-salt and drought stresses. In the osdsg1 mutant, transcript levels of ABA signaling genes and ABA responsive genes were significantly increased. By contrast, expressions of OsGAMYB and its downstream genes that encode hydrolytic enzymes were markedly reduced. These observations support that OsDSG1 is a major regulator of ABA signaling in germinating seeds. Finally, we observed that the germination rates of various rice cultivars depended upon the transcript levels of OsDSG1 and other ABA-signaling genes.
1330850.pdf	Functional dissections between GAMYB and Dof transcription factors suggest a role for protein-protein associations in the gibberellin-mediated expression of the RAmy1A gene in the rice aleurone	2003	Plant Physiol	Laboratory of Environmental Molecular Biology, Division of Bioscience, Graduate School of Environmental Earth Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0810, Japan. washi@ees.hokudai.ac.jp	In the germinated cereal aleurone layer, gibberellic acids (GA) induce expression of a number of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes that participate in the mobilization of stored molecules. Previous analyses suggest that the key events controlling the GA-regulated gene expression in the aleurone are formation of active transcription machinery referred to as the GA responsive complex, followed by recruiting GAMYB. In general, bipartite promoter contexts composed of the GA-responsive element and the pyrimidine box are observed within the regulatory regions of cereal GA-responsive genes. Protein factors that recognize each promoter sequence were identified and distinct effects on the GA-mediated activation of gene expression have been also investigated; however, the connection and intercalation between two promoter motifs remain obscure. In this study, I have evaluated cooperative function of GAMYB and a pyrimidine box-binding protein OsDOF3 that influenced the promoter activity of the most predominant GA-responsive gene (RAmy1A) of rice (Oryza sativa). Transient expression of OsDOF3 in the germinated aleurone prolonged GAMYB function on the reporter expression in the absence of GA. The synergistic effect required a set of DNA bindings of two proteins on the RAmy1A promoter region. The yeast two-hybrid assay showed the physical interaction of GAMYB and OsDOF3 in yeast cells, indicating that the association of GAMYB and OsDOF3 may be a functional unit in transcription regulation. The results showed the accessory function of OsDOF3 responsible for a dosage-dependent mediation of GA signaling that leads to high-level expression of physiological target genes.
2857.pdf	Convergent starvation signals and hormone crosstalk in regulating nutrient mobilization upon germination in cereals	2012	Plant Cell	Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei 115, Taiwan, Republic of China.	Germination is a unique developmental transition from metabolically quiescent seed to actively growing seedling that requires an ensemble of hydrolases for coordinated nutrient mobilization to support heterotrophic growth until autotrophic photosynthesis is established. This study reveals two crucial transcription factors, MYBS1 and MYBGA, present in rice (Oryza sativa) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), that function to integrate diverse nutrient starvation and gibberellin (GA) signaling pathways during germination of cereal grains. Sugar represses but sugar starvation induces MYBS1 synthesis and its nuclear translocation. GA antagonizes sugar repression by enhancing conuclear transport of the GA-inducible MYBGA with MYBS1 and the formation of a stable bipartite MYB-DNA complex to activate the alpha-amylase gene. We further discovered that not only sugar but also nitrogen and phosphate starvation signals converge and interconnect with GA to promote the conuclear import of MYBS1 and MYBGA, resulting in the expression of a large set of GA-inducible but functionally distinct hydrolases, transporters, and regulators associated with mobilization of the full complement of nutrients to support active seedling growth in cereals.
Aya-2009-Gibberellin modulate.pdf	Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB	2009	Plant Cell	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	Gibberellins (GAs) play important roles in regulating reproductive development, especially anther development. Our previous studies revealed that the MYB transcriptional factor GAMYB, an important component of GA signaling in cereal aleurone cells, is also important for anther development. Here, we examined the physiological functions of GA during anther development through phenotypic analyses of rice (Oryza sativa) GA-deficient, GA-insensitive, and gamyb mutants. The mutants exhibited common defects in programmed cell death (PCD) of tapetal cells and formation of exine and Ubisch bodies. Microarray analysis using anther RNAs of these mutants revealed that rice GAMYB is involved in almost all instances of GA-regulated gene expression in anthers. Among the GA-regulated genes, we focused on two lipid metabolic genes, a cytochrome P450 hydroxylase CYP703A3 and beta-ketoacyl reductase, both of which might be involved in providing a substrate for exine and Ubisch body. GAMYB specifically interacted with GAMYB binding motifs in the promoter regions in vitro, and mutation of these motifs in promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) transformants caused reduced GUS expression in anthers. Furthermore, a knockout mutant for CYP703A3 showed gamyb-like defects in exine and Ubisch body formation. Together, these results suggest that GA regulates exine formation and the PCD of tapetal cells and that direct activation of CYP703A3 by GAMYB is key to exine formation.
j.1365-313X.2003.01753.x.pdf	Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds	2003	The Plant Journal	Department of Biological Sciences, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Minami-ohsawa 1-1, Hachioji-shi, Tokyo 192-0397, Japan.	In germinating rice seeds, a cysteine proteinase (REP-1), synthesized in aleurone-layer cells, is a key enzyme in the degradation of the major storage protein, glutelin. The expression of the gene for REP-1 (Rep1) is induced by gibberellins (GAs) and repressed by abscisic acid (ABA). To identify GA-responsive elements in the Rep1 promoter, we developed a transient expression system in rice aleurone cells. Deletion and point-mutation analyses indicated that the GA-response complex was composed of TAACAGA, TAACGTA, and two copies of CAACTC. The two former sequences were identical to GAREs conserved in the promoter of genes for alpha-amylase and proteinases in cereals. The latter, termed as CAACTC regulatory elements (CAREs), were novel GAREs. Gain-of-function experiments revealed that two pairs of GARE and CARE were necessary and sufficient to confer GA inducibility. The sequences were also required for effective transactivation by the transcription factor OsGAMyb. Four copies of either GARE or CARE showed transactivation neither by OsGAMyb nor by GA induction. CARE and GARE were also found in the promoters of a rice alpha-amylase gene, RAmy1A, and a barley proteinase gene, EPB1, which are expressed in germinating seeds. Mutations of CARE in their promoters caused a loss of GA inducibility and GAMyb transactivation, suggesting that CARE is the regulatory element for GA-inducible expression of hydrolase genes in the germinating seeds.
j.1365-313X.2006.02795.x.pdf	GAMYB controls different sets of genes and is differentially regulated by microRNA in aleurone cells and anthers	2006	Plant J	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Furocho, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	GAMYB is a component of gibberellin (GA) signaling in cereal aleurone cells, and has an important role in flower development. However, it is unclear how GAMYB function is regulated. We examined the involvement of a microRNA, miR159, in the regulation of GAMYB expression in cereal aleurone cells and flower development. In aleurone cells, no miR159 expression was observed with or without GA treatment, suggesting that miR159 is not involved in the regulation of GAMYB and GAMYB-like genes in this tissue. miR159 was expressed in tissues other than aleurone, and miR159 over-expressors showed similar but more severe phenotypes than the gamyb mutant. GAMYB and GAMYB-like genes are co-expressed with miR159 in anthers, and the mRNA levels for GAMYB and GAMYB-like genes are negatively correlated with miR159 levels during anther development. Thus, OsGAMYB and OsGAMYB-like genes are regulated by miR159 in flowers. A microarray analysis revealed that OsGAMYB and its upstream regulator SLR1 are involved in the regulation of almost all GA-mediated gene expression in rice aleurone cells. Moreover, different sets of genes are regulated by GAMYB in aleurone cells and anthers. GAMYB binds directly to promoter regions of its target genes in anthers as well as aleurone cells. Based on these observations, we suggest that the regulation of GAMYB expression and GAMYB function are different in aleurone cells and flowers in rice.
j.1744-7909.2010.00959.x.pdf	Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development	2010	J Integr Plant Biol	School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200240, China.	In higher plants, male reproductive development is a complex biological process that includes cell division and differentiation, cell to cell communication etc., while the mechanism underlying plant male reproductive development remains less understood. GAMYB encodes a gibberellins acid (GA) inducible transcription factor that is required for the early anther development in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a new allele gamyb-4 with a C base deletion in the second exon (+2308), causing a frame shift and premature translational termination. Histological analysis showed that gamyb-4 developed abnormal enlarged tapetum and could not undergo normal meiosis. To understand the regulatory role of GAMYB, we carried out quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and comparison of microarray data. These results revealed that the expression of TDR (TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION), a tapetal cell death regulator, was downregulated in gamyb-4 and udt1 (undeveloped tapetum1). While the GAMYB expression was not obviously changed in tdr and udt1-1, and no apparent expression fold change of UDT1 in tdr and gamyb-4, suggesting that TDR may act downstream of GAMYB and UDT1, and GAMYB and UDT1 work in parallel to regulate rice early anther development. This work is helpful in understanding the regulatory network in rice anther development.
PC16010033.pdf	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	2004	Plant Cell	BioScience Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	GAMYB was first isolated as a positive transcriptional regulator of gibberellin (GA)-dependent alpha-amylase expression in barley aleurone cells, and its molecular and biochemical properties have been well characterized. However, the role of GAMYB elsewhere in the plant is not well understood. To investigate the molecular function of GAMYB outside of the aleurone cells, we isolated loss-of-function mutants from a panel of rice mutants produced by the insertion of a retrotransposon, Tos17. Through PCR screening using primers for rice GAMYB (OsGAMYB) and Tos17, we isolated three independent mutant alleles that contained Tos17 inserted in the exon region. No alpha-amylase expression in the endosperm was induced in these mutants in response to GA treatment, indicating that the Tos17 insertion had knocked out OsGAMYB function. We found no significant defects in the growth and development of the mutants at the vegetative stage. After the phase transition to the reproductive stage, however, shortened internodes and defects in floral organ development, especially a defect in pollen development, were observed. On the other hand, no difference was detected in flowering time. High-level OsGAMYB expression was detected in the aleurone cells, inflorescence shoot apical region, stamen primordia, and tapetum cells of the anther, but only low-level expression occurred in organs at the vegetative stage or in the elongating stem. These results demonstrate that, in addition to its role in the induction of alpha-amylase in aleurone, OsGAMYB also is important for floral organ development and essential for pollen development.
Plant Physiol.-2004-Zhang-1500-13.pdf	A rice WRKY gene encodes a transcriptional repressor of the gibberellin signaling pathway in aleurone cells	2004	Plant Physiol	Department of Biological Sciences, University of Nevada, 4505 Maryland Parkway, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA.	The molecular mechanism by which GA regulates plant growth and development has been a subject of active research. Analyses of the rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequences identified 77 WRKY genes, among which OsWRKY71 is highly expressed in aleurone cells. Transient expression of OsWRKY71 by particle bombardment specifically represses GA-induced Amy32b alpha-amylase promoter but not abscisic acid-induced HVA22 or HVA1 promoter activity in aleurone cells. Moreover, OsWRKY71 blocks the activation of the Amy32b promoter by the GA-inducible transcriptional activator OsGAMYB. Consistent with its role as a transcriptional repressor, OsWRKY71 is localized to nuclei of aleurone cells and binds specifically to functionally defined TGAC-containing W boxes of the Amy32b promoter in vitro. Mutation of the two W boxes prevents the binding of OsWRKY71 to the mutated promoter, and releases the suppression of the OsGAMYB-activated Amy32b expression by OsWRKY71, suggesting that OsWRKY71 blocks GA signaling by functionally interfering with OsGAMYB. Exogenous GA treatment decreases the steady-state mRNA level of OsWRKY71 and destabilizes the GFP:OsWRKY71 fusion protein. These findings suggest that OsWRKY71 encodes a transcriptional repressor of GA signaling in aleurone cells.
PNAS-2000-Ueguchi-Tanaka-11638-43.pdf	Rice dwarf mutantd1, which is defective in the a subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, affects gibberellin signal transduction	2000	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Bioscience Center and Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya, 464-8601, Japan.	Previously, we reported that the rice dwarf mutant, d1, is defective in the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein (Galpha). In the present study, gibberellin (GA) signaling in d1 and the role of the Galpha protein in the GA-signaling pathway were investigated. Compared with the wild type, GA induction of alpha-amylase activity in aleurone cells of d1 was greatly reduced. Relative to the wild type, the GA(3)-treated aleurone layer of d1 had lower expression of Ramy1A, which encodes alpha-amylase, and OsGAMYB, which encodes a GA-inducible transcriptional factor, and no increase in expression of Ca(2 +)-ATPase. However, in the presence of high GA concentrations, alpha-amylase induction occurred even in d1. The GA sensitivity of second leaf sheath elongation in d1 was similar to that of the wild type in terms of dose responsiveness, but the response of internode elongation to GA was much lower in d1. Furthermore, Os20ox expression was up-regulated, and the GA content was elevated in the stunted internodes of d1. All these results suggest that d1 affects a part of the GA-signaling pathway, namely the induction of alpha-amylase in the aleurone layer and internode elongation. In addition, a double mutant between d1 and another GA-signaling mutant, slr, revealed that SLR is epistatic to the D1, supporting that the Galpha protein is involved in GA signaling. However, the data also provide evidence for the presence of an alternative GA-signaling pathway that does not involve the Galpha protein. It is proposed that GA signaling via the Galpha protein may be more sensitive than that of the alternative pathway, as indicated by the low GA responsiveness of this Galpha-independent pathway.
tpc1802326.pdf	Interaction between rice MYBGA and the gibberellin response element controls tissue-specific sugar sensitivity of alpha-amylase genes	2006	Plant Cell	Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei 115, Republic of China.	Expression of alpha-amylase genes during cereal grain germination and seedling growth is regulated negatively by sugar in embryos and positively by gibberellin (GA) in endosperm through the sugar response complex (SRC) and the GA response complex (GARC), respectively. We analyzed two alpha-amylase promoters, alphaAmy3 containing only SRC and alphaAmy8 containing overlapped SRC and GARC. alphaAmy3 was sugar-sensitive but GA-nonresponsive in both rice (Oryza sativa) embryos and endosperms, whereas alphaAmy8 was sugar-sensitive in embryos and GA-responsive in endosperms. Mutation of the GA response element (GARE) in the alphaAmy8 promoter impaired its GA response but enhanced sugar sensitivity, and insertion of GARE in the alphaAmy3 promoter rendered it GA-responsive but sugar-insensitive in endosperms. Expression of the GARE-interacting transcription factor MYBGA was induced by GA in endosperms, correlating with the endosperm-specific alphaAmy8 GA response. alphaAmy8 became sugar-sensitive in MYBGA knockout mutant endosperms, suggesting that the MYBGA-GARE interaction overrides the sugar sensitivity of alphaAmy8. In embryos overexpressing MYBGA, alphaAmy8 became sugar-insensitive, indicating that MYBGA affects sugar repression. alpha-Amylase promoters active in endosperms contain GARE, whereas those active in embryos may or may not contain GARE, confirming that the GARE and GA-induced MYBGA interaction prevents sugar feedback repression of endosperm alpha-amylase genes. We demonstrate that the MYBGA-GARE interaction affects sugar feedback control in balanced energy production during seedling growth and provide insight into the control mechanisms of tissue-specific regulation of alpha-amylase expression by sugar and GA signaling interference.
NA	Fine-Tuning Roles of Osa-miR159a in Rice Immunity Against Magnaporthe oryzae and Development	2021	Rice (N Y)	Rice Research Institute and Key Lab for Major Crop Diseases, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	Background: Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most destructive diseases of rice. An increasing number of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to fine-tune rice immunity against M. oryzae and coordinate with growth and development.  Results: Here, we showed that rice microRNA159a (Osa-miR159a) played a positive role in rice resistance to M. oryzae. The expression of Osa-miR159a was suppressed in a susceptible accession at 12, 24, and 48 h post-inoculation (hpi); it was upregulated in a resistant accession of M. oryzae at 24 hpi. The transgenic rice lines overexpressing Osa-miR159a were highly resistant to M. oryzae. In contrast, the transgenic lines expressing a short tandem target mimic (STTM) to block Osa-miR159a showed enhanced susceptibility. Knockout mutations of the target genes of Osa-miR159a, including OsGAMYB, OsGAMYBL, and OsZF, led to resistance to M. oryzae. Alteration of the expression of Osa-miR159a impacted yield traits including pollen and grain development.  Conclusions: Our results indicated that Osa-miR159a positively regulated rice immunity against M. oryzae by downregulating its target genes. Proper expression of Osa-miR159a was critical for coordinating rice blast resistance with grain development.
