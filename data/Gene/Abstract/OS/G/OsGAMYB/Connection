OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	OsMYBS1	Convergent starvation signals and hormone crosstalk in regulating nutrient mobilization upon germination in cereals	This study reveals two crucial transcription factors, MYBS1 and MYBGA, present in rice (Oryza sativa) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), that function to integrate diverse nutrient starvation and gibberellin (GA) signaling pathways during germination of cereal grains
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	OsMYBS1	Convergent starvation signals and hormone crosstalk in regulating nutrient mobilization upon germination in cereals	GA antagonizes sugar repression by enhancing conuclear transport of the GA-inducible MYBGA with MYBS1 and the formation of a stable bipartite MYB-DNA complex to activate the alpha-amylase gene
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	OsMYBS1	Convergent starvation signals and hormone crosstalk in regulating nutrient mobilization upon germination in cereals	We further discovered that not only sugar but also nitrogen and phosphate starvation signals converge and interconnect with GA to promote the conuclear import of MYBS1 and MYBGA, resulting in the expression of a large set of GA-inducible but functionally distinct hydrolases, transporters, and regulators associated with mobilization of the full complement of nutrients to support active seedling growth in cereals
CYP703A3	OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB	Together, these results suggest that GA regulates exine formation and the PCD of tapetal cells and that direct activation of CYP703A3 by GAMYB is key to exine formation
