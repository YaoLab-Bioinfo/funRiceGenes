OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	 ga 	A rice WRKY gene encodes a transcriptional repressor of the gibberellin signaling pathway in aleurone cells	Mutation of the two W boxes prevents the binding of OsWRKY71 to the mutated promoter, and releases the suppression of the OsGAMYB-activated Amy32b expression by OsWRKY71, suggesting that OsWRKY71 blocks GA signaling by functionally interfering with OsGAMYB
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	anther	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	High-level OsGAMYB expression was detected in the aleurone cells, inflorescence shoot apical region, stamen primordia, and tapetum cells of the anther, but only low-level expression occurred in organs at the vegetative stage or in the elongating stem
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	 ga 	Loss-of-function mutations of the rice GAMYB gene impair alpha-amylase expression in aleurone and flower development	No alpha-amylase expression in the endosperm was induced in these mutants in response to GA treatment, indicating that the Tos17 insertion had knocked out OsGAMYB function
