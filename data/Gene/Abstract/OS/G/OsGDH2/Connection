OsGDH2	OsGS2|lambdaGS31	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Salt stress clearly up-regulated the expression of OsGDH2 and OsGDH3 in old leaves, while strongly down-regulated expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves
OsGDH2	OsIDD10|OsNKD	Indeterminate domain 10 regulates ammonium-mediated gene expression in rice roots	IDD10 activates the transcription of AMT1;2 and GDH2 by binding to a cis-element motif present in the promoter region of AMT1;2 and in the fifth intron of GDH2
OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	OsGDH2	Indeterminate domain 10 regulates ammonium-mediated gene expression in rice roots	IDD10 activates the transcription of AMT1;2 and GDH2 by binding to a cis-element motif present in the promoter region of AMT1;2 and in the fifth intron of GDH2
