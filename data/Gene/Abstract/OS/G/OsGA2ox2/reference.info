NA	Orchestration of ethylene and gibberellin signals determines primary root elongation in rice.	2022	Plant Cell	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Primary root growth in cereal crops is fundamental for early establishment of the seedling and grain yield. In young rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings, the primary root grows rapidly for 7-10 days after germination and then stops; however, the underlying mechanism determining primary root growth is unclear. Here, we report that the interplay of ethylene and gibberellin (GA) controls the orchestrated development of the primary root in young rice seedlings. Our analyses advance the knowledge that primary root growth is maintained by higher ethylene production, which lowers bioactive GA contents. Further investigations unraveled that ethylene signaling transcription factor ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE 1 OsEIL1 activates the expression of the GA metabolism genes GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE 2 (OsGA2ox1), OsGA2ox2, OsGA2ox3, and OsGA2ox5, thereby deactivating GA activity, inhibiting cell proliferation in the root meristem, and ultimately gradually inhibiting primary root growth. Mutation in OsGA2ox3 weakened ethylene-induced GA inactivation and reduced the ethylene sensitivity of the root. Genetic analysis revealed that OsGA2ox3 functions downstream of OsEIL1. Taken together, we identify a molecular pathway impacted by ethylene during primary root elongation in rice, and provide insight into the coordination of ethylene and GA signals during root development and seedling establishment.
