OsGLU1|OsGH9A1	cellulose	OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation	Mutation of OsGLU1 resulted in a reduction in cell elongation, and a decrease in cellulose content but an increase in pectin content, suggesting that OsGLU1 affects the internode elongation and cell wall components of rice plants
OsGLU1|OsGH9A1	growth	OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation	These results indicate that OsGLU1 plays important roles in plant cell growth
OsGLU1|OsGH9A1	brassinosteroid	OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation	Gibberellins and brassinosteroids induced OsGLU1 expression
OsGLU1|OsGH9A1	cell elongation	OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation	Mutation of OsGLU1 resulted in a reduction in cell elongation, and a decrease in cellulose content but an increase in pectin content, suggesting that OsGLU1 affects the internode elongation and cell wall components of rice plants
OsGLU1|OsGH9A1	gibberellin	OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation	Gibberellins and brassinosteroids induced OsGLU1 expression
OsGLU1|OsGH9A1	cell wall	OsGLU1, a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase from rice, affects plant internode elongation	Mutation of OsGLU1 resulted in a reduction in cell elongation, and a decrease in cellulose content but an increase in pectin content, suggesting that OsGLU1 affects the internode elongation and cell wall components of rice plants
OsGLU1|OsGH9A1	nitrate	New Insights into the Transcriptional Regulation of Genes Involved in the Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Potassium Chlorate in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	3, OsGLU1 and OsGLU2, between NR and NRT, coupled with the NR activity pattern in the roots, would indicate the prevalence of nitrate (NO3бе) transport over ammonium (NH4+) transport
