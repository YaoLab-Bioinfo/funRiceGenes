OsGH3.8|OsGH3-8|OsMGH3	auxin	Kinetic basis for the conjugation of auxin by a GH3 family indole-acetic acid-amido synthetase	Steady-state kinetic analysis shows that the OsGH3-8 requires either Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) for maximal activity and is specific for aspartate but accepts asparagine as a substrate with a 45-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency and accepts other auxin analogs, including phenyl-acetic acid, indole butyric acid, and naphthalene-acetic acid, as acyl-acid substrates with 1
