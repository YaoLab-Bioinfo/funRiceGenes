OsGRF6	OsGRF8	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	 Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing OsGRF6, OsGRF7, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 exhibited enhanced resistance to M
OsGRF6	OsGRF8	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	 While overexpression of OsGRF7 led to defects in growth, overexpression of OsGRF6, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 resulted in better or no significant change of yield traits
OsGRF7	OsGRF8	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	 Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing OsGRF6, OsGRF7, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 exhibited enhanced resistance to M
OsGRF7	OsGRF8	miR396-OsGRFs Module Balances Growth and Rice Blast Disease-Resistance.	 While overexpression of OsGRF7 led to defects in growth, overexpression of OsGRF6, OsGRF8, and OsGRF9 resulted in better or no significant change of yield traits
OsF3H	OsGRF8	The OsmiR396-OsGRF8-OsF3H-flavonoid pathway mediates resistance to the brown planthopper in rice (Oryza sativa).	 A BPH-responsive flavanone 3-hydroxylase (OsF3H) gene in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway was proved to be directly regulated by OsGRF8
OsGRF8	OsmiR396	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 The grain shape of Growth Regulating Factor8 (OsGRF8)-overexpressing transgenic plants was most similar to that of MIM396 plants, suggesting OsGRF8 is a major mediator of OsmiR396 in grain size regulation
miR408|OsMIR408	OsGRF8	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 Moreover, we revealed the direct regulatory effects of OsGRF8 on OsMIR408 expression
