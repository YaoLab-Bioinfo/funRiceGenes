10.1007-s11033-010-0553-9.pdf	Functional analysis of a rice late pollen-abundant UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (OsUgp2) promoter	2011	Mol Biol Rep	Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Biotechnology of Guangdong Province, College of Life Science, South China Agricultural University, 510642 Guangzhou, China.	OsUgp2, a rice UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene, has previously been shown to preferentially express in maturing pollens and plays an important role in pollen starch accumulation. Here, a 1943 bp promoter fragment (P1943) of OsUgp2 was characterized by 5' deletion and gain-of-function experiments. P1943 and its 5' deletion derivatives (P1495, P1005, P665 and P159) were fused to GUS reporter gene and stably introduced into rice plants. Histochemical analyses of different tissues and pollens at different developmental stages of the transgenic plants showed that P1943 could only direct GUS expression in binucleate pollens. P1495 and P1005 could still drive GUS expression in binucleate pollens but at a lower level. On the other hand, neither P665 nor P159 transformant exhibited any GUS activity in pollens. Gain-of-function analyses showed that the region (-1005 to -665 relative to translation start site) combined with a minimal CaMV 35S promoter could direct GUS expression in pollens. Further analysis of 5' deletion truncated at -952, -847 and -740 delimited a 53 bp region (-1005 to -952) essential for pollen-specific expression. The 53 bp sequence contains two motifs of TTTCT and TTTC, which were known to be pollen-specific cis-elements. In addition, the same P1943-GUS fusion construct was introduced into tobacco to analyze its specificity in dicotyledon. Interestingly, the GUS expression pattern in transgenic tobacco was quite different from that in rice. High level of GUS expression was detected in mature pollens as well as leaves, roots, sepals and stigmas. These findings suggested a complicated transcriptional regulation of OsUgp2.

Two homologous UGPase genes, OsUgp1 and OsUgp2, exist in rice genome. OsUgp1 has recently been reported to be essential for callose deposition during pollen mother cell and meiosis stages as well as for seed carbohydrate metabolism. In this study, a full-length cDNA of OsUgp2 was isolated from rice anther. Northern blot and RNA in situ hybridization indicated that the expression of OsUgp2 was preferentially in pollen and developmentally regulated. No transcripts were found in leaf, stem, lemma/palea, ripening grain and florets before the uninucleate microspore developmental stage, but a large quantity of OsUgp2 mRNA was found in pollen at the binucleate and mature stages. The immunolocalization of OsUgp2 showed a similar expression pattern to that by RNA in situ hybridization. The function of OsUgp2 was investigated by dsRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing. The pollen fertility of 16 independent transgenic rice plants was found between 25% and 90%, which was correlated with the amount of OsUgp2 mRNA. The results of morphological changes and starch variation during pollen development in transgenic rice showed that the abnormal feature of pollen development appeared after the uninucleate microspore stage. Starch failed to accumulate in pollen and thus led to sterile pollens. These results demonstrated that OsUgp2 is a pollen-preferential “late gene and plays a key role during pollen maturation, especially for starch accumulation. OsUgp2 complements OsUgp1 to fulfill the UGPase’s functions necessary for the full process of pollen development.

The rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains two homologous UGPase genes, Ugp1 and Ugp2. We report a functional characterization of rice Ugp1, which is expressed throughout the plant, with highest expression in florets, especially in pollen during anther development. Ugp1 silencing by RNA interference or cosuppression results in male sterility. Expressing a double-stranded RNA interference construct in Ugp1-RI plants resulted in complete suppression of both Ugp1 and Ugp2, together with various pleiotropic developmental abnormalities, suggesting that UGPase plays critical roles in plant growth and development. More importantly, Ugp1-cosuppressing plants contained unprocessed intron-containing primary transcripts derived from transcription of the overexpression construct. These aberrant transcripts undergo temperature-sensitive splicing in florets, leading to a novel thermosensitive genic male sterility. Pollen mother cells (PMCs) of Ugp1-silenced plants appeared normal before meiosis, but during meiosis, normal callose deposition was disrupted. Consequently, the PMCs began to degenerate at the early meiosis stage, eventually resulting in complete pollen collapse. In addition, the degeneration of the tapetum and middle layer was inhibited. These results demonstrate that rice Ugp1 is required for callose deposition during PMC meiosis and bridges the apoplastic unloading pathway and pollen development.
NA	An L-type lectin receptor-like kinase promotes starch accumulation during rice pollen maturation	2021	Development	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	Starch accumulation is key for the maturity of rice pollen grains; however, the regulatory mechanism underlying this process remains unknown. Here, we isolated a male-sterile rice mutant, abnormal pollen 1 (ap1), which produces nonviable pollen grains with defective starch accumulation. Functional analysis revealed that AP1 encodes an active L-type lectin receptor-like kinase (L-LecRLK). AP1 is localized to the plasma membrane and its transcript is highly accumulated in pollen during the starch synthesis phase. RNA-seq and phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that the expression/phosphorylation levels of numerous genes/proteins involved in starch and sucrose metabolism pathway were significantly altered in the mutant pollen, including a known rice UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (OsUGP2). We further found that AP1 physically interacts with OsUGP2 to elevate its enzymatic activity likely through targeted phosphorylation. These findings revealed a novel role of L-LecRLK in controlling pollen maturity via modulating sucrose and starch metabolism.
