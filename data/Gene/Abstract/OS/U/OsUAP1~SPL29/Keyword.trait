OsUAP1|SPL29|HES1	defence response	Functional inactivation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) induces early leaf senescence and defence responses in rice	Functional inactivation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) induces early leaf senescence and defence responses in rice
OsUAP1|SPL29|HES1	pyrophosphorylase	Functional inactivation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) induces early leaf senescence and defence responses in rice	The SPL29 gene was identified by map-based cloning, and SPL29 was confirmed as UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) by enzymatic analysis.
OsUAP1|SPL29|HES1	jasmonic acid	Functional inactivation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) induces early leaf senescence and defence responses in rice	The plant hormones jasmonic acid and abscisic acid also accumulated in spl29 plants.
OsUAP1|SPL29|HES1	abscisic acid	Functional inactivation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) induces early leaf senescence and defence responses in rice	The plant hormones jasmonic acid and abscisic acid also accumulated in spl29 plants.
