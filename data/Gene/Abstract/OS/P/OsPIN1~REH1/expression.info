OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b	 qRT-PCR analysis of OsPIN family genes showed that the expression of OsPIN1b is most abundant in root tip and is significantly downregulated by LN, LP, sodium nitroprusside (SNP, NO donor), and GR24 (analogue of SLs) treatments |  pCYCB1;1::GUS expression was upregulated by LN, LP, SNP, and GR24 treatments in wild type, but not in the ospin1b-1 mutant, suggesting that OsPIN1b is involved in auxin transport and acts as a downstream mediator of NO and SLs to induce meristem activity in root tip in rice under LN and LP
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	 Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR
