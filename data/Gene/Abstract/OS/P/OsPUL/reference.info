Starch-debranching enzymes (DBEs) are key enzymes involved in starch metabolism in cereals, having a dual function, in both starch synthesis and degradation. However, their precise roles in this pathway, particularly their expression profiles, remain unclear. In the present study, we performed a quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis of the expression pattern of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type DBE in different tissues as well as in seeds at different developmental stages. The results showed that this gene was expressed only in seeds. In addition, the 1177-bp OsPUL promoter sequence was cloned, and some endosperm-specific motifs such as the GCN4 and AACA motifs were observed to exist in this region. The promoter was then fused with the GUS reporter gene and its expression was carefully investigated in transgenic rice. The data from both histochemical and fluorometric analyses showed that the OsPUL promoter was capable of driving the target gene to have a high level of endosperm-specific expression. The OsPUL gene maintained a relatively high expression level during the entire period of seed development, and peaked in the middle and late stages. This observation was very consistent with that of the endogenous transcription analysis by Q-PCR. Furthermore, the seed germination experiment showed that the OsPUL promoter actively functions in the late stage of seed germination. The expression of the OsPUL gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism.

The present study established that there are two distinct polymeric forms of isoamylase1 (ISA1) in rice endosperm: presumably a homo-pentamer of ISA1 and a hetero-hexamer composed of five ISA1 and one ISA2. The molecular sizes of the homo- and hetero-oligomers, which could be fractionated by hydrophobic chromatography, were approximately 420-480 and 510-550 kDa, respectively. The hetero-oligomer exhibited higher affinities for various branched polyglucans, especially for phytoglycogen, which had a K(m) value that was approximately 12 times lower relative to that with the homo-oligomer, although no marked differences were found in chain preferences for debranching of amylopectin and phytoglycogen between these forms. The hetero-oligomer was active even when incubated at 50 degrees C for 10 min, while the homo-multimer was completely inactivated at 40 degrees C in 10 min. When the ISA1 homo-oligomer was incubated with the ISA2 protein expressed in Escherichia coli and applied onto a nondenature polyacrylamide gel, additional debranching activity bands which were specific for the purified ISA1-ISA2 preparation were also detected, indicating that ISA1 and ISA2 combine to form a hetero-oligomer. These results suggest that the hetero-oligomer plays a predominant role in the amylopectin biosynthesis in rice endosperm although the homo-oligomer can complement the function of the hetero-oligomer at least to some extent.
pcr058.pdf	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai, Tsukuba, Japan.	Debranching enzymes, which hydrolyze alpha-1 and 6-glucosidic linkages in alpha-polyglucans, play a dual role in the synthesis and degradation of starch in plants. A transposon-inserted rice mutant of isoamylase3 (isa3) contained an increased amount of starch in the leaf blade at the end of the night, indicating that ISA3 plays a role in the degradation of transitory starch during the night. An epitope-tagged ISA3 expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited hydrolytic activity on beta-limit dextrin and amylopectin. We investigated whether ISA3 plays a role in amyloplast development and starch metabolism in the developing endosperm. ISA3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein expressed under the control of the rice ISA3 promoter was targeted to the amyloplast stroma in the endosperm. Overexpression of ISA3 in the sugary1 mutant, which is deficient in ISA1 activity, did not convert water-soluble phytoglycogen to starch granules, indicating that ISA1 and ISA3 are not functionally redundant. Both overexpression and loss of function of ISA3 in the endosperm generated pleomorphic amyloplasts and starch granules. Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic. These results suggest that ISA3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects morphological characteristics of plastids in rice.
NA	Sequence variations in OsAGPase significantly associated with amylose content and viscosity properties in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2012	Genet Res (Camb)	Department of Plant Resources, College of Industrial Sciences, Kongju National University, Yesan 340-802, Republic of Korea.	Sequence-based variations in starch synthesis-related genes (SSRGs) exert a basic influence on the determination of eating quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.). This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the sequence variations from parts of 10 SSRGs and the amylose content (AC) plus rapid viscosity analysis (RVA) profiles in a heuristic rice core set by association mapping (AM). In total, 86 sequence variations were found in 10 sequenced amplicons, including 79 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), six insertion-deletions (InDels) and one polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR). Among them, 61 variations were exon-based, of which 41 should lead to amino acid changes. Four subpopulations were revealed by population structure analysis based on 170 genome-wide SSR genotypes. The final AM showed a sum of four significant associations between three phenotypic indices and three sequence variations. An ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase small unit 1 (OsAGPS1) SNP (A-G) was significantly associated with increased AC (P&lt;0·001, R(2)=15·6%), while a 12-bp deletion of AGPase large unit 4 (OsAGPL4) was significantly related to the decreased breakdown viscosity (BDV) (P&lt;0·001, R(2)=16·6%) in both general linear model (GLM) and mixed linear model (MLM). This study provides a new perspective of allele mining for breeding strategies based on marker-assisted selection.
