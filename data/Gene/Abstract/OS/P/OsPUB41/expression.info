OsPUB41	Overexpression of OsPUB41, a Rice E3 ubiquitin ligase induced by cell wall degrading enzymes, enhances immune responses in Rice and Arabidopsis. |  Expression of the rice E3 ubiquitin ligase, OsPUB41, is enhanced upon treatment of leaves with Xanthomonas oryzae pv | Expression of the rice E3 ubiquitin ligase, OsPUB41, is induced when rice leaves are treated with either CWDEs, pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or pathogens |  Overexpression of OsPUB41 leads to induction of callose deposition, enhanced tolerance to Xoo and Rhizoctonia solani infection in rice and Arabidopsis respectively |  In rice, transient overexpression of OsPUB41 leads to enhanced expression of PR genes and SA as well as JA biosynthetic and response genes |  However, in Arabidopsis, ectopic expression of OsPUB41 results in upregulation of only JA biosynthetic and response genes |  Transient overexpression of either of the two biochemically inactive mutants (OsPUB41C40A and OsPUB41V51R) of OsPUB41 in rice and stable transgenics in Arabidopsis ectopically expressing OsPUB41C40A failed to elicit immune responses	Overexpression of OsPUB41, a Rice E3 ubiquitin ligase induced by cell wall degrading enzymes, enhances immune responses in Rice and Arabidopsis. |  Overexpression of OsPUB41 leads to induction of callose deposition, enhanced tolerance to Xoo and Rhizoctonia solani infection in rice and Arabidopsis respectively |  In rice, transient overexpression of OsPUB41 leads to enhanced expression of PR genes and SA as well as JA biosynthetic and response genes |  Transient overexpression of either of the two biochemically inactive mutants (OsPUB41C40A and OsPUB41V51R) of OsPUB41 in rice and stable transgenics in Arabidopsis ectopically expressing OsPUB41C40A failed to elicit immune responses
