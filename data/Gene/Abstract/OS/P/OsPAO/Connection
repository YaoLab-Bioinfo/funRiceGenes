OsPAO	OsRCCR1	Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice	In this report, a single PAO gene (OsPAO) and two RCCR genes (OsRCCR1 and OsRCCR2) have been isolated from rice
OsPAO	OsRCCR1	Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice	These results suggest that OsPAO and OsRCCR1 play key roles in senescence and are involved in wound responses
OsPAO	OsRCCR1	Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice	Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice
OsPAO	SGR|OsSGR	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	SGR, like the gene for pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO), was constitutively expressed, but was upregulated by dark-induced senescence in rice leaves
OsPAO	SGR|OsSGR	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin
OsPAO	SGR|OsSGR	Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice	According to these observations, we propose that SGR may be involved in regulating or taking part in the activity of PaO, and then may influence Chl breakdown and degradation of pigment-protein complex
