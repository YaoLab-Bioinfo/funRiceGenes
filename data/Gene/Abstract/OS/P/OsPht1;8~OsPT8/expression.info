OsPht1;8|OsPT8	 In this study, we knocked down expression of a phosphate transporter gene OsPht1;8 (OsPT8) selectively in shoot and/or in seed endosperm by RNA-interference using RISBZ1 and GluB-1 promoter (designate these transgenic lines as SSRi and EnSRi), respectively, to characterize the role of OsPT8 in P redistribution of rice
OsPht1;8|OsPT8	 Nipponbare showed 2- to 3-fold higher expression of the Pi transporter genes OsPT2 and OsPT8 than Kasalath |  The results also suggest that differential OsPT8 expression explains the varietal differences in As(V) uptake and tolerance between Kasalath and Nipponbare
OsPht1;8|OsPT8	 High Zn supply triggered P starvation signal in root, thereafter increased the activities of both root-endogenous and -secreted acid phosphatase to release more Pi, and induced the expression OsPT2 and OsPT8 to uptake more P for plant growth
