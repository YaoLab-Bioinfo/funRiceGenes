OsPht1;11|OsPT11	OsPht1;13|OsPT13	Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family	To better understand this pathway, we combined genetic, molecular, and physiological approaches to determine the specific functions of two symbiosis-specific members of the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) gene family from rice, ORYsa;PHT1;11 (PT11) and ORYsa;PHT1;13 (PT13)
OsPht1;11|OsPT11	OsPht1;13|OsPT13	Nonredundant regulation of rice arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis by two members of the phosphate transporter1 gene family	Surprisingly, mutations in either PT11 or PT13 affected the development of the symbiosis, demonstrating that both genes are important for AM symbiosis
OsPht1;11|OsPT11	OsZAS	Zaxinone synthase controls arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization level in rice.	 OsZAS is expressed in arbuscule-containing cells, and OsPT11prom::OsZAS transgenic lines, where OsZAS expression is driven by the OsPT11 promoter active in arbusculated cells, exhibit increased mycorrhization compared with the wild type
