OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR3	Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.	Here, we identified functional redundancy among three PHR1 orthologs in rice, OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3, using phylogenetic and mutation analysis
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR3	Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.	OsPHR3, in conjunction with OsPHR1 and OsPHR2, function in transcriptional activation of most Pi starvation-induced (PSI) genes
OsPHR1|PHR1	OsPHR3	Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.	We propose that OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3 form a network and play diverse roles in regulating Pi signaling and homeostasis in rice

OsPHR3	OsPHR4	Phosphate starvation induced OsPHR4 mediates Pi-signaling and homeostasis in rice.	The expression of OsPHR4 is positively regulated by OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3
NRT1|OsNRT1|OsNRT1.1	OsPHR3	OsPHR3 affects the traits governing nitrogen homeostasis in rice.	 During vegetative growth phase, compared with the wild-type, OsPHR3 mutants showed significant variations in the adventitious root development, influx rates of 15N-NO3- and 15N-NH4+, concentrations of total N, NO3- and NH4+ in different tissues, and the relative expression levels of OsNRT1
