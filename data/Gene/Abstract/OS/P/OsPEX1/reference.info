Rice leucine-rich repeat extensin-like protein OsPEX1 mediates the intersection of lignin deposition and plant growth. Lignin, a major structural component of secondary cell wall, is essential for normal plant growth and development. However, the molecular and genetic regulation of lignin biosynthesis is not fully understood in rice. Here we report the identification and characterization of a rice semi-dominant dwarf mutant (pex1) with stiff culm. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that the pex1 phenotype was caused by ectopic expression of a leucine-rich repeat extension-like gene, OsPEX1. Interestingly, the pex1 mutant showed significantly higher lignin content and increased expression levels of lignin-related genes compared with wild type plants. Conversely, OsPEX1-suppresssed transgenics displayed low lignin content and reduced transcriptional abundance of genes associated with lignin biosynthesis, indicating that the OsPEX1 mediates lignin biosynthesis and/or deposition in rice. When OsPEX1 was ectopically expressed in rice cultivars with tall stature that lacks the allele of semi-dwarf 1, well-known green revolution gene, the resulting transgenic plants displayed reduced height and enhanced lodging resistance. Our study uncovers a causative effect between the expression of OsPEX1 and lignin deposition. Lastly, we demonstrated that modulating OsPEX1 expression could provide a tool for improving rice lodging resistance.
