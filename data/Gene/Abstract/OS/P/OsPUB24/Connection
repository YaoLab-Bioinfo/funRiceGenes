OsBZR1	OsPUB24	OsBZR1 turnover mediated by OsSK22-regulated U-box E3 ligase OsPUB24 in rice BR response.	OsBZR1 turnover mediated by OsSK22-regulated U-box E3 ligase OsPUB24 in rice BR response.
OsBZR1	OsPUB24	OsBZR1 turnover mediated by OsSK22-regulated U-box E3 ligase OsPUB24 in rice BR response.	 Here, we report that a rice U-box E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase OsPUB24 acts as a negative regulator in the BR signaling pathway via 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of OsBZR1
OsBZR1	OsPUB24	OsBZR1 turnover mediated by OsSK22-regulated U-box E3 ligase OsPUB24 in rice BR response.	 OsPUB24 ubiquitinated OsBZR1, resulting in the proteasomal degradation of OsBZR1
OsBZR1	OsPUB24	OsBZR1 turnover mediated by OsSK22-regulated U-box E3 ligase OsPUB24 in rice BR response.	 Our findings suggest that OsPUB24 participates in OsBZR1 turnover and the regulatory networks of OsPUB24, OsSK22, and OsBZR1 are crucial for fine-tuning the BR response in rice
