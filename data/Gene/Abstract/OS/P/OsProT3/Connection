OsProT1	OsProT3	OsProT1 and OsProT3 Function to Mediate Proline- and ¦Ã-aminobutyric acid-specific Transport in Yeast and are Differentially Expressed in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	OsProT1 and OsProT3 Function to Mediate Proline- and ¦Ã-aminobutyric acid-specific Transport in Yeast and are Differentially Expressed in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
OsProT1	OsProT3	OsProT1 and OsProT3 Function to Mediate Proline- and ¦Ã-aminobutyric acid-specific Transport in Yeast and are Differentially Expressed in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	Here we identified OsProT1 and OsProT3 as functional transporters for Pro and GABA
OsProT1	OsProT3	OsProT1 and OsProT3 Function to Mediate Proline- and ¦Ã-aminobutyric acid-specific Transport in Yeast and are Differentially Expressed in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Transient expression of eGFP-OsProTs in plant protoplasts revealed that both OsProT1 and OsProT3 are localized to the plasma membrane
OsProT1	OsProT3	OsProT1 and OsProT3 Function to Mediate Proline- and ¦Ã-aminobutyric acid-specific Transport in Yeast and are Differentially Expressed in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Ectopic expression in a yeast mutant demonstrated that both OsProT1 and OsProT3 specifically mediate transport of Pro and GABA with affinity for Pro in the low affinity range
OsProT1	OsProT3	OsProT1 and OsProT3 Function to Mediate Proline- and ¦Ã-aminobutyric acid-specific Transport in Yeast and are Differentially Expressed in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 qRT-PCR analyses suggested that OsProT1 was preferentially expressed in leaf sheathes during vegetative growth, while OsProT3 exhibited relatively high expression levels in several tissues, including nodes, panicles and roots
OsProT1	OsProT3	OsProT1 and OsProT3 Function to Mediate Proline- and ¦Ã-aminobutyric acid-specific Transport in Yeast and are Differentially Expressed in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Interestingly, both OsProT1 and OsProT3 were induced by cadmium stress in rice shoots
OsProT1	OsProT3	OsProT1 and OsProT3 Function to Mediate Proline- and ¦Ã-aminobutyric acid-specific Transport in Yeast and are Differentially Expressed in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	Our results suggested that plasma membrane-localized OsProT1 and OsProT3 efficiently transport Pro and GABA when ectopically expressed in yeast and appear to be involved in various physiological processes, including adaption to cadmium stress in rice plants
