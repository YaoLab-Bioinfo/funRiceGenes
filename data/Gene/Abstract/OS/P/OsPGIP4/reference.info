OsPGIP4 overexpression enhances resistance to bacterial leaf streak in rice. Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins are thought to play important roles in the innate immunity of rice against fungi. Here, we show that the chromosomal location of OsPGIP4 coincides with the major bacterial leaf streak resistance quantitative trait locus qBlsr5a on the short arm of chromosome 5. OsPGIP4 expression was up-regulated upon inoculation with the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola strain RS105. OsPGIP4 overexpression enhanced the resistance of the susceptible rice variety Zhonghua 11 to RS105. In contrast, repressing OsPGIP4 expression resulted in an increase in disease lesions caused by RS105 in Zhonghua 11 and in Acc8558, a qBlsr5a resistance donor. More interestingly, upon inoculation, the activated expression of pathogenesis-related genes was attenuated for those genes involved in the salicylic acid pathway, while the activated expression of jasmonic acid pathway markers was increased in the overexpression lines. Our results not only provide the first report that rice PGIP could enhance resistant against a bacterial pathogen but also indicate that OsPGIP4 is a potential component of the qBlsr5a locus for bacterial leaf streak in rice.
