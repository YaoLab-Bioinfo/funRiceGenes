OsHRZ1	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 In this study, we reveal that OsPRI1 interacts with OsHRZ1
OsHRZ1	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 In vitro ubiquitination experiments indicated that OsPRI1 is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1
OsHRZ1	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 Cell-free degradation assays revealed that the stability of OsPRI1 decreased in wild type roots, but increased in the hrz1-2 mutant, suggesting OsHRZ1 is responsible for the instability of OsPRI1
OsHRZ1	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe-deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade
OsIRO2|OsbHLH056	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggested that OsPRI1 binds to the OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 promoters
OsIRO2|OsbHLH056	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe-deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade
OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggested that OsPRI1 binds to the OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 promoters
OsIRO3|OsOsbHLH063	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1 (OsPRI1) positively regulates iron homeostasis in rice.	 Collectively, these results imply that OsPRI1, which is ubiquitinated by OsHRZ1, mediates rice responses to Fe-deficiency by positively regulating OsIRO2 and OsIRO3 expression as part of the OsHRZ1-OsPRI1-OsIRO2/3 signal transduction cascade
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059|OsPRI3	OsPRI1|OsbHLH115	Oryza sativa POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON DEFICIENCY RESPONSE 2 (OsPRI2) and OsPRI3 are involved in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis.	 In this study, we identified and functionally characterized OsPRI2 and OsPRI3, two paralogs of OsPRI1, observing that they directly interact with OsHRZ1
