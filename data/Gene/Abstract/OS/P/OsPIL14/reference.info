71_1183.pdf	Characterization of a Set of Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like bHLH Proteins inOryza sativa	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, School of Agriculture, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.	The model dicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana has a characteristic small sub-family of phytochrome-interacting bHLH (basic Helix-Loop-Helix) factors, which are collectively designated the PIL (or PIF) (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE) family proteins. In this study, we identified and characterized a set of highly homologous members (designated OsPIL11 to OsPIL16) in the model monocotyledon rice (Oryza sativa). Some of them (OsPIL11, OsPIL12, and OsPIL13) showed the ability to interact with the putative OsPRR1 (PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 1) clock component, as far as the results of yeast two-hybrid assays were concerned. It was found that the expression of OsPIL13 is under the control of circadian rhythms (clock), while the expression of OsPIL15 is negatively regulated by light upon the onset to light exposure of etiolated seedlings. When the rice genes (OsPIL11 to OsPIL15) were over-expressed in A. thaliana, the resulting transgenic seedlings displayed anomalous morphologies with very long hypocotyls during early photomorphogenesis. These results suggest the view that the identified OsPILs are functional counterparts (or orthologs) of AtPILs, which are known to play important roles in red light-mediated (phyA and/or phyB-dependent) signal transduction pathways at immediate positions downstream of the photoreceptor in A. thaliana.
NA	Rice phytochrome-interacting factor protein OsPIF14 represses OsDREB1B gene expression through an extended N-box and interacts preferentially with the active form of Phytochrome B.	2015	Biochim Biophys Acta	Genomics of Plant Stress Unit., Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica António Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa and Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnológica., Av. da República, 2780-157 Oeiras, Portugal.	DREB1/CBF genes, known as major regulators of plant stress responses, are rapidly and transiently induced by low temperatures. Using a Yeast one Hybrid screening, we identified a putative Phytochrome-Interacting bHLH Factor (OsPIF14), as binding to the OsDREB1B promoter. bHLH proteins are able to bind to hexameric E-box (CANNTG) or N-box (CACG(A/C)G) motifs, depending on transcriptional activity. We have shown that OsPIF14 binds to the OsDREB1B promoter through two N-boxes and that the flanking regions of the hexameric core are essential for protein-DNA interaction and stability. We also showed that OsPIF14 down-regulates OsDREB1B gene expression in rice protoplasts, corroborating the OsPIF14 repressor activity observed in the transactivation assays using Arabidopsis protoplasts. In addition, we showed that OsPIF14 is indeed a Phytochrome Interacting Factor, which preferentially binds to the active form (Pfr) of rice phytochrome B. This raises the possibility that OsPIF14 activity might be modulated by light. However, we did not observe any regulation of the OsDREB1B gene expression by light under control conditions. Moreover, OsPIF14 gene expression was shown to be modulated by different treatments, such as drought, salt, cold and ABA. Interestingly, OsPIF14 showed also a specific cold-induced alternative splicing. All together, these results suggest the possibility that OsPIF14 is involved in cross-talk between light and stress signaling through interaction with the OsDREB1B promoter. Although in the absence of stress, OsDREB1B gene expression was not regulated by light, given previous reports, it remains possible that OsPIF14 has a role in light modulation of stress responses.
NA	PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE14 and SLENDER RICE1 interaction controls seedling growth under salt stress 	2020	Plant Physiol	  Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing China [CN].	Early seedling development and emergence from the soil, which are critical for plant growth and important for crop production, are controlled by internal factors, such as phytohormones, and external factors, such as light and salt. However, little is known about how light and salt signals are integrated with endogenous cues in controlling plant physiological processes. Here, we show that overexpression of rice (Oryza sativa) PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE14 (OsPIL14), or loss of function of the DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), promotes mesocotyl and root growth, specifically in the dark and under salt stress. Furthermore, salt induces OsPIL14 turnover but enhances SLR1 accumulation. OsPIL14 directly binds to the promoter of cell elongation-related genes and regulates their expression. SLR1 physically interacts with OsPIL14 and negatively regulates its function. Our study reveals a mechanism by which the OsPIL14-SLR1 transcriptional module integrates light and gibberellin signals to fine-tune seedling growth under salt stress, enhancing understanding about how crops adapt to saline environments.
