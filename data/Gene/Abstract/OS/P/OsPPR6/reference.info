OsPPR6, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in editing and splicing chloroplast RNA, is required for chloroplast biogenesis in rice. The chloroplast has its own genetic material and genetic system, but it is also regulated by nuclear-encoded genes. However, little is known about nuclear-plastid regulatory mechanisms underlying early chloroplast biogenesis in rice. In this study, we isolated and characterized a mutant, osppr6, that showed early chloroplast developmental defects leading to albino leaves and seedling death. We found that the osppr6 mutant failed to form thylakoid membranes. Using map-based cloning and complementation tests, we determined that OsPPR6 encoded a new Pentatricopeptide Repeat (PPR) protein localized in plastids. In the osppr6 mutants, mRNA levels of plastidic genes transcribed by the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase decreased, while those of genes transcribed by the nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase increased. Western blot analyses validated these expression results. We further investigated plastidic RNA editing and splicing in the osppr6 mutants and found that the ndhB transcript was mis-edited and the ycf3 transcript was mis-spliced. Therefore, we demonstrate that OsPPR6, a PPR protein, regulates early chloroplast biogenesis and participates in editing of ndhB and splicing of ycf3 transcripts in rice.
