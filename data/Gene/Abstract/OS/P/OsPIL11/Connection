OsPIL11	OsPRR1	Characterization of a Set of Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like bHLH Proteins inOryza sativa	Some of them (OsPIL11, OsPIL12, and OsPIL13) showed the ability to interact with the putative OsPRR1 (PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 1) clock component, as far as the results of yeast two-hybrid assays were concerned
APG|OsPIL16	OsPIL11	Characterization of a Set of Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like bHLH Proteins inOryza sativa	In this study, we identified and characterized a set of highly homologous members (designated OsPIL11 to OsPIL16) in the model monocotyledon rice (Oryza sativa)

OsPIL11	OsPIL15	Characterization of a Set of Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like bHLH Proteins inOryza sativa	When the rice genes (OsPIL11 to OsPIL15) were over-expressed in A
OsPIL11	OsPIL13|OsPIL1	Characterization of a Set of Phytochrome-Interacting Factor-Like bHLH Proteins inOryza sativa	In this study, we identified and characterized a set of highly homologous members (designated OsPIL11 to OsPIL16) in the model monocotyledon rice (Oryza sativa)

OsPIL11	OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	PIL transcription factors directly interact with SPLs and repress tillering/branching in plants.	 In rice, overexpression and loss-of-function mutations of OsPIL11 reduce or increase tiller number by regulating the expression of OsTB1
