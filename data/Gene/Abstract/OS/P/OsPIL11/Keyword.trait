OsPIL11	leaf	Expression Patterns of OsPIL11, a Phytochrome-Interacting Factor in Rice, and Preliminary Analysis of Its Roles in Light Signal Transduction	The expression of OsPIL11 was organ-specific and was regulated by leaf development, abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA)

OsPIL11	salicylic acid	Expression Patterns of OsPIL11, a Phytochrome-Interacting Factor in Rice, and Preliminary Analysis of Its Roles in Light Signal Transduction	The expression of OsPIL11 was organ-specific and was regulated by leaf development, abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA)
OsPIL11	seedling	Expression Patterns of OsPIL11, a Phytochrome-Interacting Factor in Rice, and Preliminary Analysis of Its Roles in Light Signal Transduction	When grown under continuous red light, OsPIL11-overexpressed transgenic tobacco exhibited shorter hypocotyls and larger cotyledons and leaves compared to wild-type seedlings
OsPIL11	leaf development	Expression Patterns of OsPIL11, a Phytochrome-Interacting Factor in Rice, and Preliminary Analysis of Its Roles in Light Signal Transduction	The expression of OsPIL11 was organ-specific and was regulated by leaf development, abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA)
OsPIL11	tiller	PIL transcription factors directly interact with SPLs and repress tillering/branching in plants.	 In rice, overexpression and loss-of-function mutations of OsPIL11 reduce or increase tiller number by regulating the expression of OsTB1
OsPIL11	tiller number	PIL transcription factors directly interact with SPLs and repress tillering/branching in plants.	 In rice, overexpression and loss-of-function mutations of OsPIL11 reduce or increase tiller number by regulating the expression of OsTB1
