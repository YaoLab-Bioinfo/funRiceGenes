OsNPR1|NH1	OsPR1a|OsSCP	Functions of rice NAC transcriptional factors, ONAC122 and ONAC131, in defense responses against Magnaporthe grisea	OsLOX, OsPR1a, OsWRKY45 and OsNH1) were down-regulated in plants silenced for ONAC122 or ONAC131 expression via the BMV-based silencing system
OsPR1a|OsSCP	OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Functions of rice NAC transcriptional factors, ONAC122 and ONAC131, in defense responses against Magnaporthe grisea	OsLOX, OsPR1a, OsWRKY45 and OsNH1) were down-regulated in plants silenced for ONAC122 or ONAC131 expression via the BMV-based silencing system
ONAC122|OsNAC10	OsPR1a|OsSCP	Functions of rice NAC transcriptional factors, ONAC122 and ONAC131, in defense responses against Magnaporthe grisea	OsLOX, OsPR1a, OsWRKY45 and OsNH1) were down-regulated in plants silenced for ONAC122 or ONAC131 expression via the BMV-based silencing system
OsMPK6|OsMPK4	OsPR1a|OsSCP	Opposite functions of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase during the process of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae	Xoo infection induced the expression of PR1a, the marker gene of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), in systemic health tissues of OsMPK6-knock-out plants
OsPR1a|OsSCP	OsWRKY10	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	 OsWRKY10 activated the OsPR1a promoter by binding to specific WRKY binding sites
OsPR1a|OsSCP	OsWRKY10	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	 OsWRKY10 activated OsPR1a in two distinct ways: by binding to its promoter and, at the same time, by indirect activation through OsWRKY47
OsPR1a|OsSCP	OsWRKY47	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	 OsWRKY10 activated OsPR1a in two distinct ways: by binding to its promoter and, at the same time, by indirect activation through OsWRKY47
