OsPRR1|OsTOC1	flower	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	Flowering genes downstream of OsPRR1 such as OsGI and Hd1 were down regulated in the A654 mutant
OsPRR1|OsTOC1	flower	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	In addition, OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 colocalize with OsPRR1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis APRR1 gene that controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function
OsPRR1|OsTOC1	flower	An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15	Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering
