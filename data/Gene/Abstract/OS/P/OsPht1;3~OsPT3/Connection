OsPht1;3|OsPT3	OsPIE1	A phosphate-starvation induced RING-type E3 ligase maintains phosphate homeostasis partially through OsSPX2 in rice.	 Under Pi-sufficient condition, overexpression of OsPIE1 upregulated the expression of OsPT2, OsPT3, OsPT10 and OsPAP21b, resulting in Pi accumulation and acid phosphatases (APases) induction in roots
