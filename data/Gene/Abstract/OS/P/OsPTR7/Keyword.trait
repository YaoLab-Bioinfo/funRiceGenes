OsPTR7|OsNPF8.1|OsNPF8.10	root	OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a Putative Peptide Transporter in Rice, is Involved in Dimethylarsenate Accumulation in Rice Grain.	 Knockout or knockdown mutants of OsPTR7 had significantly decreased root to shoot translocation of DMA compared with wild-type plants and accumulated less As in the brown rice
OsPTR7|OsNPF8.1|OsNPF8.10	shoot	OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a Putative Peptide Transporter in Rice, is Involved in Dimethylarsenate Accumulation in Rice Grain.	 Knockout or knockdown mutants of OsPTR7 had significantly decreased root to shoot translocation of DMA compared with wild-type plants and accumulated less As in the brown rice
OsPTR7|OsNPF8.1|OsNPF8.10	grain	OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a Putative Peptide Transporter in Rice, is Involved in Dimethylarsenate Accumulation in Rice Grain.	 Our study demonstrates that OsPTR7 is involved in the long-distance translocation of DMA and contributes to the accumulation of DMA in rice grain
OsPTR7|OsNPF8.1|OsNPF8.10	seedling	OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a Putative Peptide Transporter in Rice, is Involved in Dimethylarsenate Accumulation in Rice Grain.	 Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that OsPTR7 was more highly expressed in the shoots than in the roots at the seedling stage
OsPTR7|OsNPF8.1|OsNPF8.10	transporter	OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a Putative Peptide Transporter in Rice, is Involved in Dimethylarsenate Accumulation in Rice Grain.	OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a Putative Peptide Transporter in Rice, is Involved in Dimethylarsenate Accumulation in Rice Grain.
OsPTR7|OsNPF8.1|OsNPF8.10	plasma membrane	OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a Putative Peptide Transporter in Rice, is Involved in Dimethylarsenate Accumulation in Rice Grain.	 Transient expression of the OsPTR7-green fluorescent protein (GFP) in tobacco protoplasts showed that OsPTR7 was localized in the cell plasma membrane
OsPTR7|OsNPF8.1|OsNPF8.10	grain-filling	OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a Putative Peptide Transporter in Rice, is Involved in Dimethylarsenate Accumulation in Rice Grain.	 At the flowering and grain-filling stage, the OsPTR7 transcript was abundant in the leaves, node I and roots
OsPTR7|OsNPF8.1|OsNPF8.10	node	OsPTR7 (OsNPF8.1), a Putative Peptide Transporter in Rice, is Involved in Dimethylarsenate Accumulation in Rice Grain.	 At the flowering and grain-filling stage, the OsPTR7 transcript was abundant in the leaves, node I and roots
