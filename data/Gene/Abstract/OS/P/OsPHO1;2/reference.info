Plant Physiol.-2010-Secco-1693-704.pdf	Characterization of the rice PHO1 gene family reveals a key role for OsPHO1;2 in phosphate homeostasis and the evolution of a distinct clade in dicotyledons	2010	Plant Physiol	Departement de Biologie Moleculaire Vegetale, Biophore, Universite de Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.	Phosphate homeostasis was studied in a monocotyledonous model plant through the characterization of the PHO1 gene family in rice (Oryza sativa). Bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis showed that the rice genome has three PHO1 homologs, which cluster with the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtPHO1 and AtPHO1;H1, the only two genes known to be involved in root-to-shoot transfer of phosphate. In contrast to the Arabidopsis PHO1 gene family, all three rice PHO1 genes have a cis-natural antisense transcript located at the 5 ' end of the genes. Strand-specific quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed distinct patterns of expression for sense and antisense transcripts for all three genes, both at the level of tissue expression and in response to nutrient stress. The most abundantly expressed gene was OsPHO1;2 in the roots, for both sense and antisense transcripts. However, while the OsPHO1;2 sense transcript was relatively stable under various nutrient deficiencies, the antisense transcript was highly induced by inorganic phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Characterization of Ospho1;1 and Ospho1;2 insertion mutants revealed that only Ospho1;2 mutants had defects in Pi homeostasis, namely strong reduction in Pi transfer from root to shoot, which was accompanied by low-shoot and high-root Pi. Our data identify OsPHO1;2 as playing a key role in the transfer of Pi from roots to shoots in rice, and indicate that this gene could be regulated by its cis-natural antisense transcripts. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of PHO1 homologs in monocotyledons and dicotyledons revealed the emergence of a distinct clade of PHO1 genes in dicotyledons, which include members having roles other than long-distance Pi transport.
NA	Node-localized transporters of phosphorus essential for seed development in rice.	2020	Plant Cell Physiol.	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Chuo 2-20-1, Kurashiki, Japan.	About 60-85% of total phosphorus (P) in cereal crops is finally allocated to the seeds, which is required for seed development, germination, and early growth. However, little is known on the molecular mechanisms underlying P allocation to the seeds. Here, we found that two members (OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2) belonging to PHO1 gene family, are involved in the distribution of P to the seeds in rice. Both OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 were localized to the plasma membrane and showed influx transport activities for inorganic phosphate. At the reproductive stage, both OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 showed higher expression in the node I, the uppermost node connecting to panicle. OsPHO1;1 was mainly localized at the phloem region of diffuse vascular bundles of node I, while OsPHO1;2 was expressed in the xylem parenchyma cells of the enlarged vascular bundles. In addition, they were also expressed in the ovular vascular trace, the outer layer of the inner integument (OsPHO1;1) and the nucellar epidermis (OsPHO1;2) of caryopsis. Knockout of OsPHO1;2 as well as OsPHO1;1 with less extent decreased the distribution of P to the seed, resulting in decreased seed size and delayed germination. Taken together, OsPHO1;2 expressed in node I is responsible for unloading of P from the xylem of enlarged vascular bundles, while OsPHO1;1 is involved in reloading P into phloem of diffuse vascular bundles for subsequent allocation of P to the seeds. Furthermore, OsPHO1;1 and OsPHO1;2 expressed in the caryopsis are important for delivering of P from the maternal tissues to the filial tissues for seed development.
