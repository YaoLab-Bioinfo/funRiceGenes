10.1007-BF00037023.pdf	Molecular cloning of two novel rice cDNA sequences encoding putative calcium-dependent protein kinases	1995	Plant Mol Biol	Istituto Biosintesi Vegetali, C.N.R., Milan, Italy.	We have isolated, from a cDNA library constructed from rice coleoptiles, two sequences, OSCPK2 and OSCPK11, that encode for putative calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) proteins. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 cDNAs are related to SPK, another gene encoding a rice CDPK that is specifically expressed in developing seeds [20]. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11-predicted protein sequences are 533 and 542 amino acids (aa) long with a corresponding molecular mass of 59436 and 61079 Da respectively. Within their polypeptide chain, they all contain those conserved features that define a plant CDPK; kinase catalytic sequences are linked to a calmodulin-like regulatory domain through a junction region. The calmodulin-like regulatory domain of the predicted OSCPK2 protein contains 4 EF-hand calcium-binding sites while OSCPK11 has conserved just one canonical EF-hand motif. In addition, OSCPK2- and OSCPK11-predicted proteins contain, at their N-terminal region preceding the catalytic domain, a stretch of 80 or 74 residues highly rich in hydrophilic amino acids. Comparison of the NH2-terminal sequence of all three rice CDPKs so far identified (OSCPK2, OSCPK11 and SPK) indicates the presence of a conserved MGxxC(S/Q)xxT motif that may define a consensus signal for N-myristoylation. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 proteins are both encoded by a single-copy gene and their polyadenylated transcripts are 2.4 and 3.5 kb long respectively. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 mRNAs are equally abundant in rice roots and coleoptiles. A 12 h white light treatment of the coleoptiles reduces the amount of OSCPK2 mRNA with only a slight effect on the level of OSCPK11 transcript. With anoxic treatments, OSCPK2 mRNA level declined significantly and promptly while the amount of OSCPK11 transcript remained constant.

Bands of the expected molecular sizes for OsCDPK2 (59 kDa) and OsCDPK11 (61 kDa) were detected on western blots. OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 mRNA and protein levels increased in unison during flower development. However, at the onset of seed development, the protein expression profiles diverged significantly. OsCDPK2 protein was expressed at low levels during early seed development, but increased to high levels that were maintained in later stages (20 days after fertilisation, DAF). Conversely, OsCDPK11 protein levels were high at the beginning of seed development, but fell rapidly from 10 DAF onwards. This decrease in the level of OsCDPK11 protein was associated with the abundant synthesis of a truncated mRNA species. OsCDPK2 expression was also closely associated with light perception. OsCDPK2 protein was barely detectable in green leaves exposed to light, but levels increased sharply when plants were shifted to darkness. Initially, this increase reflected a rapid elevation in the levels of OsCDPK2 mRNA, which was normally located in the mesophyll. Conversely, OsCDPK11 mRNA and protein levels were unaffected by light. These data strongly indicate that two rice CDPK isoforms have different functions in seed development and in response to light in leaves.

High levels of OsCDPK2 were detected in leaves removed from etiolated plants, as well as in stems and flowers. However, there was no overexpression in green leaves that had been exposed to light, confirming that OsCDPK2 protein stability was subject to light regulation. The morphological phenotype of transgenic plants producing high levels of recombinant OsCDPK2 was normal until the onset of seed development. Flowers developed normally, producing well-shaped ovaries and stigmas, and mature anthers filled with pollen grains. However, seed formation in these plants was strongly inhibited, with only 3<U+393C><U+3E33>7% of the flowers producing seeds. Seed development was arrested at an early stage. We discuss these data with respect to the possible requirement for specific CDPK isoforms during rice seed 4.4ptdevelopment.

Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), the most abundant serine/threonine kinases in plants, are found in various subcellular localizations, which suggests that this family of kinases may be involved in multiple signal transduction pathways. A complete analysis to try to understand the molecular basis of the presence of CDPKs in various localizations in the cell has not been accomplished yet. It has been suggested that myristoylation may be responsible for membrane association of CDPKs. In this study, we used a rice CDPK, OSCPK2, which has a consensus sequence for myristoylation at the N-terminus, to address this question. We expressed wild-type OSCPK2 and various mutants in different heterologous systems to investigate the factors that affect its membrane association. The results show that OSCPK2 is myristoylated and palmitoylated and targeted to the membrane fraction. Both modifications are required, myristoylation being essential for membrane localization and palmitoylation for its full association. The fact that palmitoylation is a reversible modification may provide a mechanism for regulation of the subcellular localization. OSCPK2 is the first CDPK shown to be targeted to membranes by an src homology domain 4 (SH4) located at the N-terminus of the molecule.

Plant calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are involved in calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways. Their expression is finely tuned in different tissues and in response to specific signals, but the mechanism of such a regulation is still largely unknown. OsCDPK2 gene expression is modulated in vivo during rice (Oryza sativa L.) flower development and is downregulated by white light in leaves. In order to identify OsCDPK2 regulatory sequences, we amplified and cloned both the 5' and 3'-flanking regions of the gene. Sequence analysis revealed that the leader sequence is interrupted by an intron, whose regulatory role was investigated. Different ss-gucuronidase (GUS) expression vectors, carrying combinations of the putative OsCDPK2 regulatory regions, were generated and GUS expression was analyzed both in transient assays and in transgenic rice plants. The whole 5'-flanking sequence was able to drive GUS expression in rice calli and leaves transiently transformed with the biolistic technique. Analysis of the GUS expression pattern in transgenic plants revealed strong activity in root tips, leaf veins and mesophyll cells, in flower reproductive organs and in mature pollen grains. Expression was also shown to be subject to an intron-mediated enhancement (IME) mechanism, since the deletion of the leader intron sequence from chimeric OsCDPK2::GUS plasmids almost completely abolished GUS activity. Furthermore, in transiently transformed leaves, GUS expression driven by the OsCDPK2 promoter-leader region was constitutively observed regardless of light or dark exposure. Light-regulated expression was restored by inserting the OsCDPK2 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) downstream of the chimeric OsCDPK2::GUS transcription unit, suggesting that light down-regulation is mediated by a mechanism driven by the 3'UTR.
