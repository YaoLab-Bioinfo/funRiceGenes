Bot.-2013-Yoshikawa-2049-61.pdf	Rice slender leaf 1 gene encodes cellulose synthase-like D4 and is specifically expressed in M-phase cells to regulate cell proliferation	2013	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Cellulose synthase-like (CSL) genes are predicted to catalyse the biosynthesis of non-cellulosic polysaccharides such as the beta-D-glycan backbone of hemicelluloses and are classified into nine subfamilies (CSLA-CSLH and CSLJ). The CSLD subfamily is conserved in all land plants, and among the nine CSL subfamilies, it shows the highest sequence similarity to the cellulose synthase genes, suggesting that it plays fundamental roles in plant development. This study presents a detailed analysis of slender leaf 1 (sle1) mutants of rice that showed rolled and narrow leaf blades and a reduction in plant height. The narrow leaf blade of sle1 was caused by reduced cell proliferation beginning at the P3 primordial stage. In addition to the size reduction of organs, sle1 mutants exhibited serious developmental defects in pollen formation, anther dehiscence, stomata formation, and cell arrangement in various tissues. Map-based cloning revealed that SLE1 encodes the OsCSLD4 protein, which was identified previously from a narrow leaf and dwarf 1 mutant. In situ hybridization experiments showed that OsCSLD4 was expressed in a patchy pattern in developing organs. Double-target in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that SLE1 was expressed specifically during the M-phase of the cell cycle, and suggested that the cell-cycle regulation was altered in sle1 mutants. These results suggest that the OsCSLD4 protein plays a pivotal role in the M phase to regulate cell proliferation. Further study of OsCSLD4 is expected to yield new insight into the role of hemicelluloses in plant development.

Cellulose synthase-like (CSL) proteins of glycosyltransferase family 2 (GT2) are believed to be involved in the biosynthesis of cell-wall polymers. The CSL D sub-family (CSLD) is common to all plants, but the functions of CSLDs remain to be elucidated. We report here an in-depth characterization of a narrow leaf and dwarf1 (nd1) rice mutant that shows significant reduction in plant growth due to retarded cell division. Map-based cloning revealed that ND1 encodes OsCSLD4, one of five members of the CSLD sub-family in rice. OsCSLD4 is mainly expressed in tissues undergoing rapid growth. Expression of OsCSLD4 fluorescently tagged at the C- or N-terminus in rice protoplast cells or Nicotiana benthamiana leaves showed that the protein is located in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi vesicles. Golgi localization was verified using phenotype-rescued transgenic plants expressing OsCSLD4-GUS under the control of its own promoter. Two phenotype-altered tissues, culms and root tips, were used to investigate the specific wall defects. Immunological studies and monosaccharide compositional and glycosyl linkage analyses explored several wall compositional effects caused by disruption of OsCSLD4, including alterations in the structure of arabinoxylan and the content of cellulose and homogalacturonan, which are distinct in the monocot grass species Oryza sativa (rice). The inconsistent alterations in the two tissues and the observable structural defects in primary walls indicate that OsCSLD4 plays important roles in cell-wall formation and plant growth.

The cellulose synthase-like super-families were reported to contain glycosyltransferases motif and are required for the biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharides. Here, we describe a curled leaf and dwarf mutant, cd1, in rice, which exhibits multiple phenotypic traits such as the reduction of plant height and leaf width, curled leaf morphology and a decrease in the number of grains and in the panicle length. Map-based cloning indicates that a member of the cellulose synthase-like D (CSLD) group is a candidate for OsCD1. RNAi transgenic plants with the candidate CSLD gene display a similar phenotype to the cd1 mutant, suggesting that OsCD1 is a member of the CSLD sub-family. Furthermore, sequence analysis indicates that OsCD1 contains the common D,D,D,QXXRW motif, which is a feature of the cellulose synthase-like super-family. Analysis of OsCD1 promoter with GUS fusion expression shows that OsCD1 exhibits higher expression in young meristem tissues such as fresh roots, young panicle and stem apical meristem. Cell wall composition analysis reveals that cellulose content and the level of xylose are significantly reduced in mature culm owing to loss of OsCD1 function. Take together, the work presented here is useful for expanding the understanding of cell wall biosynthesis.

Appropriate leaf shape has proved to be useful in improving photosynthesis and increasing grain yield. To understand the molecular mechanism of leaf morphogenesis, we identified a rice mutant nrl1, which was characterized by a phenotype of narrow and rolled leaves. Microscopic observation showed that the mutation significantly decreased the number of vascular bundles of leaf and stem. Genetic analysis revealed that the mutation was controlled by a single nuclear-encoded recessive gene. To isolate the nrl1 gene, 756 F(2) and F(3) mutant individuals from a cross of the nrl1 mutant with Longtepu were used and a high-resolution physical map of the chromosomal region around the nrl1 gene was made. Finally, the gene was mapped in 16.5 kb region between marker RL21 and marker RL36 within the BAC clone OSJNBa0027H05. Cloning and sequencing of the target region from the mutant showed that there was a 58 bp deletion within the second exon of the cellulose synthase-like D4 gene (TIGR locus Os12g36890). The nrl1 mutation was rescued by transformation with the wild-type cellulose synthase-like D4 gene. Accordingly, the cellulose synthase-like D4 gene was identified as the NRL1 gene. NRL1 was transcribed in various tissues and was mainly expressed in panicles and internodes. NAL7 and SLL1 were found to be upregulated, whereas OsAGO7 were downregulated in the nrl1 mutant. These findings suggested that there might be a functional association between these genes in regulating leaf development.

Leaf morphology is an important agronomic trait in rice breeding. We isolated three allelic mutants of NARROW AND ROLLED LEAF 1 (nrl1) which showed phenotypes of reduced leaf width and semi-rolled leaves and different degrees of dwarfism. Microscopic analysis indicated that the nrl1-1 mutant had fewer longitudinal veins and smaller adaxial bulliform cells compared with the wild-type. The NRL1 gene was mapped to the chromosome 12 and encodes the cellulose synthase-like protein D4 (OsCslD4). Sequence analyses revealed single base substitutions in the three allelic mutants. Genetic complementation and over-expression of the OsCslD4 gene confirmed the identity of NRL1. The gene was expressed in all tested organs of rice at the heading stage and expression level was higher in vigorously growing organs, such as roots, sheaths and panicles than in elsewhere. In the mutant leaves, however, the expression level was lower than that in the wild-type. We conclude that OsCslD4 encoded by NRL1 plays a critical role in leaf morphogenesis and vegetative development in rice.
NA	DNL1, encodes cellulose synthase-like D4, is a major QTL for plant height and leaf width in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2014	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China. Electronic address: 2012101127@njau.edu.cn.	To further understand the genetics characterize of plant height and leaf width, we selected two different rice germplasms in phenotypes, Xian80 and Suyunuo, to construct genetic population. QTL analysis in a 175 F2 population revealed that major QTLs, qPH12 and qLW12.2, explaining 50.00% and 57.08% phenotypic variation for plant height and leaf width, respectively, were located on the same interval of chromosome 12 flanking SSR markers RM519 and RM1103, and was named DNL1 (Dwarf and Narrowed Leaf 1). Using a segregating populations derived from F2 heterozygous individuals, a total of 1363 dwarfism and narrowed-leaf individuals was selected for screening recombinants. By high-resolution linkage analysis in 141 recombination events, DNL1 was narrowed to a 62.39kb region of InDel markers ID12M28 and HF43. The results of ORF analysis in target region and nucleotide sequence alignment indicated that DNL1 encodes cellulose synthase-like D4 protein, and a single nucleotide substitution (C2488T) in dnl1 result in decrease in plant height and leaf width. Bioinformatical analysis demonstrated that a conserved role for OsCSLD4 in the regulation of plant growth and development. Expression analysis for OsCSLDs showed CSLD4 was highly expressed in roots, while other CSLD members had comparatively lower expression levels, however no clearly evidence about CSLD4/DNL1 expression associated with its function.
NA	Characterization of dwarf and narrow leaf ( dnl-4) mutant in rice	2020	Plant Signal Behav	College of Life Science and Natural Resources, Dong-A University , Busan, Korea.	Height and leaf morphology are important agronomic traits of the major crop plant rice (Oryza sativa). In previous studies, the dwarf and narrow leaf genes (dnl1, dnl2 and dnl3) have identified in rice. Using the Ac/Ds knockout system, we found a new dwarf and narrow leaf (dnl) mutant and identified mutated gene. The dnl-4 mutant showed reduced plant height and leaf blade width compared to the wild type, and increased leaf inclination. The morphological defects of the mutant were caused by the suppressed expression of the DNL-4 gene, which encodes a pfkB carbohydrate kinase protein. These results suggest that DNL-4 expression is involved in modulating plant height and leaf growth. Furthermore, DNL-4 expression also affects productivity in rice: the dnl-4 mutant exhibited reduced panicle length and grain width compared with the wild type. To understand DNL-4 function in rice, we analyzed the expression levels of leaf growth-related genes, such as NAL1, NAL7, and CSLD4, in the dnl-4 mutant. Expression of NAL1 and NAL7 was downregulated in the dnl-4 mutant compared to the wild type. The observation that DNL-4 expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and NAL7 is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the dnl-4 mutant. These results suggest that DNL-4 regulates plant height and leaf structure in rice.
NA	Cadmium inhibits lateral root emergence in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution and the protective effect of OsHMA3	2020	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Cadmium (Cd) strongly inhibits root growth, especially the formation of lateral roots (LRs). The mechanism of Cd inhibition on LR formation in rice (Oryza sativa) remains unclear. In this study, we found that LR emergence in rice was inhibited significantly by 1 ¦ÌM Cd and almost completely arrested by 5 ¦ÌM Cd. Cadmium suppressed both the formation and subsequent development of the lateral root primordium (LRP). By using transgenic rice expressing the auxin response reporters DR5::GUS and DR5rev::VENUS, we found that Cd markedly reduced the auxin levels in the stele and LRP. Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and OsPIN9 in the stele and LPR. The emergence of LRs in a rice cultivar with a null allele of OsHMA3 (Heavy Metal ATPase 3) was more sensitive to Cd than cultivars with functional alleles. Overexpression of functional OsHMA3 in rice greatly alleviated the inhibitory effect of Cd, but the protective effect of OsHMA3 was abolished by the auxin polar transport inhibitor 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid. The results suggest that Cd inhibits LR development in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution to LPR and OsHMA3 protects against Cd toxicity by sequestering Cd into the vacuoles.
