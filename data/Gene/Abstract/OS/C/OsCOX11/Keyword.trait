COX11|OsCOX11	cell death	A detrimental mitochondrial-nuclear interaction causes cytoplasmic male sterility in rice	In CMS-WA lines, WA352 accumulates preferentially in the anther tapetum, thereby inhibiting COX11 function in peroxide metabolism and triggering premature tapetal programmed cell death and consequent pollen abortion
COX11|OsCOX11	tapetum	A detrimental mitochondrial-nuclear interaction causes cytoplasmic male sterility in rice	In CMS-WA lines, WA352 accumulates preferentially in the anther tapetum, thereby inhibiting COX11 function in peroxide metabolism and triggering premature tapetal programmed cell death and consequent pollen abortion
COX11|OsCOX11	pollen	A detrimental mitochondrial-nuclear interaction causes cytoplasmic male sterility in rice	In CMS-WA lines, WA352 accumulates preferentially in the anther tapetum, thereby inhibiting COX11 function in peroxide metabolism and triggering premature tapetal programmed cell death and consequent pollen abortion
COX11|OsCOX11	anther	A detrimental mitochondrial-nuclear interaction causes cytoplasmic male sterility in rice	In CMS-WA lines, WA352 accumulates preferentially in the anther tapetum, thereby inhibiting COX11 function in peroxide metabolism and triggering premature tapetal programmed cell death and consequent pollen abortion
COX11|OsCOX11	mitochondria	A detrimental mitochondrial-nuclear interaction causes cytoplasmic male sterility in rice	Here we report that a new mitochondrial gene, WA352, which originated recently in wild rice, confers CMS-WA because the protein it encodes interacts with the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein COX11
COX11|OsCOX11	tapetal	A detrimental mitochondrial-nuclear interaction causes cytoplasmic male sterility in rice	In CMS-WA lines, WA352 accumulates preferentially in the anther tapetum, thereby inhibiting COX11 function in peroxide metabolism and triggering premature tapetal programmed cell death and consequent pollen abortion
