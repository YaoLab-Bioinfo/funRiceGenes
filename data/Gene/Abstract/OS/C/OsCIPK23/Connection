OsCBL1	OsCIPK23	The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex	These findings demonstrate that Os-AKT1-mediated K+ uptake in rice roots is modulated by the Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex.
OsCBL1	OsCIPK23	The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex	The Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex could enhance Os-AKT1-mediated K+ uptake.
OsCBL1	OsCIPK23	The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex	Similar to the AKT1 regulation in Arabidopsis, Os-CBL1 and Os-CIPK23 were identified as the upstream regulators of Os-AKT1 in rice.
