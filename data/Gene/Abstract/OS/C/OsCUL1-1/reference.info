Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex is known as the largest family of E3 ligases. The most widely characterized CRL, SCF complex (CRL1), utilizes CUL1 as a scaffold protein to assemble the complex components. To better understand CRL1-mediated cellular processes in rice, three CUL1 genes (OsCUL1s) were isolated in Oryza sativa. Although all OsCUL1 proteins exhibited high levels of amino acid similarities with each other, OsCUL1-3 had a somewhat distinct structure from OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2. Basal expression levels of OsCUL1-3 were much lower than those of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 in all selected samples, showing that OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 play predominant roles relative to OsCUL1-3 in rice. OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 genes were commonly upregulated in dry seeds and by ABA and salt/drought stresses, implying their involvement in ABA-mediated processes. These genes also showed similar expression patterns in response to various hormones and abiotic stresses, alluding to their functional redundancy. Expression of the OsCUL1-3 gene was also induced in dry seeds and by ABA-related salt and drought stresses, implying their participation in ABA responses. However, its expression pattern in response to hormones and abiotic stresses was somehow different from those of the OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2 genes. Taken together, these findings suggest that the biological role and function of OsCUL1-3 may be distinct from those of OsCUL1-1 and OsCUL1-2. The results of expression analysis of OsCUL1 genes in this study will serve as a useful platform to better understand overlapping and distinct roles of OsCUL1 proteins and CRL1-mediated cellular processes in rice plants.
