OsCPK24|OsCDPK14	OsDi19-4	OsDi19-4 acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response in rice.	OsDi19-4 acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response in rice.
OsCPK24|OsCDPK14	OsDi19-4	OsDi19-4 acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response in rice.	Additionally, OsCDPK14 was identified to interact with OsDi19-4 and be responsible for the phosphorylation of OsDi19-4, and the phosphorylation of OsDi19-4 was further enhanced after the treatment of ABA
OsCPK24|OsCDPK14	OsDi19-4	OsDi19-4 acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response in rice.	Taken together, these data demonstrate that OsDi19-4 acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response by modulating the expression of ABA-responsive genes in rice
