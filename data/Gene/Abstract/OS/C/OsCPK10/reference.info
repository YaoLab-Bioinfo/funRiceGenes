Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are crucial calcium sensors involved in plant responses to pathogen infection. Here, we report isolation and functional characterization of the pathogen-responsive rice OsCPK10 gene. The expression of OsCPK10 was strongly induced following treatment with a Magnaporthe grisea elicitor. Kinase activity assay showed that the functional OsCPK10 protein not only autophosphorylated, but also phosphorylated Casein in a calcium-dependent manner. Overexpression of constitutively active OsCPK10 in Arabidopsis enhanced the resistance to infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, associated with elevated expression of both SA- and JA-related defense genes. Similarly, transgenic rice plants containing constitutively active OsCPK10 exhibited enhanced resistance to blast fungus M. grisea. The enhanced resistance in the transgenic lines was associated with activated expression of SA- and JA-related defense genes. Collectively, our results indicate that rice OsCPK10 is a crucial regulator in plant immune responses, and that it may regulate disease resistance by activating both SA- and JA-dependent defense responses.
