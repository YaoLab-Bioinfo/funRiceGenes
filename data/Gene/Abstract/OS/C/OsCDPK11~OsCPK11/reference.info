Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play an important role in rice signal transduction, but the precise role of each individual CDPK is still largely unknown. Recently, a full-length cDNA encoding OsCDPK13 from rice seedling was isolated. To characterize the function of OsCDPK13, its responses to various stresses and hormones were analyzed in this study. OsCDPK13 accumulated in 2-week-old leaf sheath and callus, and became phosphorylated in response to cold and gibberellin (GA). OsCDPK13 gene expression and protein accumulation were up-regulated in response to GA3 treatment, but suppressed in response to abscisic acid and brassinolide. Antisense OsCDPK13 transgenic rice lines were shorter than the vector control lines, and the expression of OsCDPK13 was lower in dwarf mutants of rice than in wild type. Furthermore, OsCDPK13 gene expression and protein accumulation were enhanced in response to cold, but suppressed under salt and drought stresses. Sense OsCDPK13 transgenic rice lines had higher recovery rates after cold stress than vector control rice. The expression of OsCDPK13 was stronger in cold-tolerant rice varieties than in cold-sensitive ones. The results suggest that OsCDPK13 might be an important signaling component in the response of rice to GA and cold stress.

We have isolated, from a cDNA library constructed from rice coleoptiles, two sequences, OSCPK2 and OSCPK11, that encode for putative calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) proteins. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 cDNAs are related to SPK, another gene encoding a rice CDPK that is specifically expressed in developing seeds [20]. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11-predicted protein sequences are 533 and 542 amino acids (aa) long with a corresponding molecular mass of 59436 and 61079 Da respectively. Within their polypeptide chain, they all contain those conserved features that define a plant CDPK; kinase catalytic sequences are linked to a calmodulin-like regulatory domain through a junction region. The calmodulin-like regulatory domain of the predicted OSCPK2 protein contains 4 EF-hand calcium-binding sites while OSCPK11 has conserved just one canonical EF-hand motif. In addition, OSCPK2- and OSCPK11-predicted proteins contain, at their N-terminal region preceding the catalytic domain, a stretch of 80 or 74 residues highly rich in hydrophilic amino acids. Comparison of the NH2-terminal sequence of all three rice CDPKs so far identified (OSCPK2, OSCPK11 and SPK) indicates the presence of a conserved MGxxC(S/Q)xxT motif that may define a consensus signal for N-myristoylation. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 proteins are both encoded by a single-copy gene and their polyadenylated transcripts are 2.4 and 3.5 kb long respectively. OSCPK2 and OSCPK11 mRNAs are equally abundant in rice roots and coleoptiles. A 12 h white light treatment of the coleoptiles reduces the amount of OSCPK2 mRNA with only a slight effect on the level of OSCPK11 transcript. With anoxic treatments, OSCPK2 mRNA level declined significantly and promptly while the amount of OSCPK11 transcript remained constant.

Bands of the expected molecular sizes for OsCDPK2 (59 kDa) and OsCDPK11 (61 kDa) were detected on western blots. OsCDPK2 and OsCDPK11 mRNA and protein levels increased in unison during flower development. However, at the onset of seed development, the protein expression profiles diverged significantly. OsCDPK2 protein was expressed at low levels during early seed development, but increased to high levels that were maintained in later stages (20 days after fertilisation, DAF). Conversely, OsCDPK11 protein levels were high at the beginning of seed development, but fell rapidly from 10 DAF onwards. This decrease in the level of OsCDPK11 protein was associated with the abundant synthesis of a truncated mRNA species. OsCDPK2 expression was also closely associated with light perception. OsCDPK2 protein was barely detectable in green leaves exposed to light, but levels increased sharply when plants were shifted to darkness. Initially, this increase reflected a rapid elevation in the levels of OsCDPK2 mRNA, which was normally located in the mesophyll. Conversely, OsCDPK11 mRNA and protein levels were unaffected by light. These data strongly indicate that two rice CDPK isoforms have different functions in seed development and in response to light in leaves.

The rice calcium-dependent protein kinase 13 (CDPK13) and calreticulin interacting protein 1 (CRTintP1) have previously been reported to be involved in cold stress response in rice. In this study, rice lines transformed with sense CDPK13 or CRTintP1 constructs were produced and used to investigate the function of these proteins. When the plants were incubated at 5 degrees C for 3 days, leaf blades of both the sense transgenic and vector control rice plants became wilted and curled. When the plants were transferred back to non-stress conditions after cold treatment, the leaf blades died, but the sheaths remained green in the sense transgenic rice plants. Expression of CDPK13 or CRTintP1 was further examined in several rice varieties including cold-tolerant rice varieties. Accumulation of these proteins in the cold-tolerant rice variety was higher than that in rice varieties that are intermediate in their cold tolerance. To examine whether over-expression of CDPK13 and CRTintP1 would have any effect on the proteins or not, sense transgenic rice plants were analyzed using proteomics. The 2D-PAGE profiles of proteins from the vector control were compared with those of the sense transgenic rice plants. Two of the proteins that differed between these lines were calreticulins. The results suggest that CDPK13, calreticulin and CRTintP1 might be important signaling components for response to cold stress in rice.

A calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 gene (OsCDPK1) was identified by differential screening of a cDNA library derived from sucrose-starved rice suspension cells. The expression of OsCDPK1 was found to be specifically activated by sucrose starvation among several stress conditions tested as well as activated transiently during post-germination seedling growth. In gain- and loss-of-function studies performed with transgenic rice overexpressing a constitutively active or RNA interference gene knockdown construct, respectively, OsCDPK1 was found to negatively regulate the expression of enzymes essential for GA biosynthesis. In contrast, OsCDPK1 activated the expression of a 14-3-3 protein, GF14c. Overexpression of either constitutively active OsCDPK1 or GF14c enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings. Hence, our studies demonstrated that OsCDPK1 transduces the post-germination Ca(2+) signal derived from sugar starvation and GA, refines the endogenous GA concentration and prevents drought stress injury, all essential functions to seedling development at the beginning of the life cycle in rice.
NA	Overexpression of a constitutively active truncated form of OsCDPK1 confers disease resistance by affecting OsPR10a expression in rice.	2018	Sci Rep	Department of Agronomy, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, 600, Taiwan.	The rice pathogenesis-related protein OsPR10a was scarcely expressed in OsCDPK1-silenced (Ri-1) rice, which was highly sensitive to pathogen infection. After inoculating the leaves with bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; Xoo), we found that the expression of OsPR10a was up- and down-regulated in OEtr-1 (overexpression of the constitutively active truncated form of OsCDPK1) and Ri-1 rice plants, respectively. OsPR10a and OsCDPK1 showed corresponding expression patterns and were up-regulated in response to the jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and Xoo treatments, and OsPR1 and OsPR4 were significantly up-regulated in OEtr-1. These results suggest that OsCDPK1 may be an upstream regulator involved in rice innate immunity and conferred broad-spectrum of disease resistance. Following the Xoo inoculation, the OEtr-1 and Ri-1 seedlings showed enhanced and reduced disease resistance, respectively. The dihybrid rice Ri-1/OsPR10a-Ox not only bypassed the effect of OsCDPK1 silencing on the susceptibility to Xoo but also showed enhanced disease resistance and, consistent with Ri-1 phenotypes, increased plant height and grain size. Our results reveal that OsCDPK1 plays novel key roles in the cross-talk and mediation of the balance between stress response and development and provides a clue for improving grain yield and disease resistance simultaneously in rice.
