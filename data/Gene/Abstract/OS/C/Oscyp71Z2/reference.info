Bacterial blight is one of the most destructive rice diseases, which caused by Xoo, and results in yield losses, endangering worldwide food security. Diterpenoid phytoalexins, a type of antimicrobials produced in rice, are critical for resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens. This article reports the characterization of the cytochrome P450 gene Oscyp71Z2, which belongs to the CYP71Z subfamily. Overexpression of Oscyp71Z2 in rice enhanced resistance to Xoo at the booting stage. The accumulation of phytoalexins was rapidly and strongly induced in Oscyp71Z2-overexpressing plants, and the transcript levels of genes related to the phytoalexin biosynthesis pathway were elevated. The H(2)O(2) concentration in Oscyp71Z2-overexpressing plants was reduced in accordance with the increase in ROS-scavenging ability due to the induction of SOD as well as POD and CAT activation. We also showed that suppression of Oscyp71Z2 had no significantly effect on disease resistance to Xoo in rice. These results demonstrated that Oscyp71Z2 plays an important role in bacterial blight resistance by regulating the diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis and H(2)O(2) generation.
