Rice has the unique ability to express alpha-amylase under anoxic conditions, a feature that is critical for successful anaerobic germination and growth. Previously, anaerobic conditions were shown to up-regulate the expression of Amy3 subfamily genes (Amy3B/C, 3D, and 3E) in rice embryos. These genes are known to be feedback regulated by the hydrolytic products of starchy endosperm such as the simple sugar glucose. It was found that oxygen deficiency interferes with the repression of Amy3D gene expression imposed by low concentrations of glucose but not with that imposed by higher amounts. This differential anoxic de-repression depending on sugar concentration suggests the presence of two distinct pathways for sugar regulation of Amy3D gene expression. Anoxic de-repression can be mimicked by treating rice embryos with inhibitors of ATP synthesis during respiration. Other sugar-regulated rice alpha-amylase genes, Amy3B/C and 3E, behave similarly to Amy3D. Treatment with a respiratory inhibitor or anoxia also relieved the sugar repression of the rice CIPK15 gene, a main upstream positive regulator of SnRK1A that is critical for Amy3D expression in response to sugar starvation. SnRK1A accumulation was previously shown to be required for MYBS1 expression, which transactivates Amy3D by binding to a cis-acting element found in the proximal region of all Amy3 subfamily gene promoters (the TA box). Taken together, these results suggest that prevention of oxidative phosphorylation by oxygen deficiency interferes with the sugar repression of Amy3 subfamily gene expression, leading to their enhanced expression in rice embryos during anaerobic germination.
j.1438-8677.2010.00415.x.pdf	Regulatory interplay of the Sub1A and CIPK15 pathways in the regulation of alpha-amylase production in flooded rice plants	2011	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Department of Crop Plant Biology, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) can successfully germinate and grow even when flooded. Rice varieties possessing the submergence 1A (Sub1A) gene display a distinct flooding-tolerant phenotype, associated with lower carbohydrate consumption and restriction of the fast-elongation phenotype typical of flooding-intolerant rice varieties. Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase 15 (CIPK15) was recently indicated as a key regulator of alpha-amylases under oxygen deprivation, linked to both rice germination and flooding tolerance in adult plants. It is still unknown whether the Sub1A- and CIPK15-mediated pathways act as complementary processes for rice survival under O(2) deprivation. In adult plants Sub1A and CIPK15 may perhaps play an antagonistic role in terms of carbohydrate consumption, with Sub1A acting as a starch degradation repressor and CIPK15 as an activator. In this study, we analysed sugar metabolism in the stem of rice plants under water submergence by selecting cultivars with different traits associated with flooding survival. The relation between the Sub1A and the CIPK15 pathways was investigated. The results show that under O(2) deprivation, the CIPK15 pathway is repressed in the tolerant, Sub1A-containing, FR13A variety. CIPK15 is likely to play a role in the up-regulation of Ramy3D in flooding-intolerant rice varieties that display fast elongation under flooding and that do not possess Sub1A.
Plant Physiol.-2010-Kurusu-678-92.pdf	Regulation of Microbe-Associated Molecular Pattern-Induced Hypersensitive Cell Death, Phytoalexin Production, and Defense Gene Expression by Calcineurin B-Like Protein-Interacting Protein Kinases, OsCIPK14/15, in Rice Cultured Cells	2010	Plant Physiol	Department of Applied Biological Science, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba 278-8510, Japan.	Although cytosolic free Ca(2+) mobilization induced by microbe/pathogen-associated molecular patterns is postulated to play a pivotal role in innate immunity in plants, the molecular links between Ca(2+) and downstream defense responses still remain largely unknown. Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) act as Ca(2+) sensors to activate specific protein kinases, CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). We here identified two CIPKs, OsCIPK14 and OsCIPK15, rapidly induced by microbe-associated molecular patterns, including chitooligosaccharides and xylanase (Trichoderma viride/ethylene-inducing xylanase [TvX/EIX]), in rice (Oryza sativa). Although they are located on different chromosomes, they have over 95% nucleotide sequence identity, including the surrounding genomic region, suggesting that they are duplicated genes. OsCIPK14/15 interacted with several OsCBLs through the FISL/NAF motif in yeast cells and showed the strongest interaction with OsCBL4. The recombinant OsCIPK14/15 proteins showed Mn(2+)-dependent protein kinase activity, which was enhanced both by deletion of their FISL/NAF motifs and by combination with OsCBL4. OsCIPK14/15-RNAi transgenic cell lines showed reduced sensitivity to TvX/EIX for the induction of a wide range of defense responses, including hypersensitive cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, phytoalexin biosynthesis, and pathogenesis-related gene expression. On the other hand, TvX/EIX-induced cell death was enhanced in OsCIPK15-overexpressing lines. Our results suggest that OsCIPK14/15 play a crucial role in the microbe-associated molecular pattern-induced defense signaling pathway in rice cultured cells.
pp1441416.pdf	Characterization of stress-responsive CIPK genes in rice for stress tolerance improvement	2007	Plant Physiol	National Center of Plant Gene Research, National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Plants respond to adverse environments by initiating a series of signaling processes that often involves diverse protein kinases, including calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). In this study, putative CIPK genes (OsCIPK01-OsCIPK30) in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome were surveyed for their transcriptional responses to various abiotic stresses. The results showed that 20 OsCIPK genes were differentially induced by at least one of the stresses, including drought, salinity, cold, polyethylene glycol, and abscisic acid treatment. Most of the genes induced by drought or salt stress were also induced by abscisic acid treatment but not by cold. A few CIPK genes containing none of the reported stress-responsive cis-elements in their promoter regions were also induced by multiple stresses. To prove that some of these stress-responsive OsCIPK genes are potentially useful for stress-tolerance improvement, three CIPK genes (OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15) were overexpressed in japonica rice 'Zhonghua 11'. Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes OsCIPK03, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively. Under cold and drought stresses, OsCIPK03- and OsCIPK12-overexpressing transgenic plants accumulated significantly higher contents of proline and soluble sugars than the wild type. Putative proline synthetase and transporter genes had significantly higher expression level in the transgenic plants than in the wild type. The differentially induced expression of OsCIPK genes by different stresses and the examples of improved stress tolerance of the OsCIPK transgenic rice suggest that rice CIPK genes have diverse roles in different stress responses and some of them may possess potential usefulness in stress-tolerance improvement of rice.
sigtrans.pdf	Coordinated responses to oxygen and sugar deficiency allow rice seedlings to tolerate flooding	2009	Sci Signal	Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Neihu, Taipei 114, Taiwan, ROC.	Flooding is a widespread natural disaster that leads to oxygen (O(2)) and energy deficiency in terrestrial plants, thereby reducing their productivity. Rice is unusually tolerant to flooding, but the underlying mechanism for this tolerance has remained elusive. Here, we show that protein kinase CIPK15 [calcineurin B-like (CBL)-interacting protein kinase] plays a key role in O(2)-deficiency tolerance in rice. CIPK15 regulates the plant global energy and stress sensor SnRK1A (Snf1-related protein kinase 1) and links O(2)-deficiency signals to the SnRK1-dependent sugar-sensing cascade to regulate sugar and energy production and to enable rice growth under floodwater. Our studies contribute to understanding how rice grows under the conditions of O(2) deficiency necessary for growing rice in irrigated lowlands.
NA	Dynamic genome-wide association analysis and identification of candidate genes involved in anaerobic germination tolerance in rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	National Engineering Research Center of Plant Space Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Background: In Asian rice production, an increasing number of countries now choose the direct seeding mode because of rising costs, labour shortages and water shortages. The ability of rice seeds to undergo anaerobic germination (AG) plays an important role in the success of direct seeding.  Results: In this study, we used 2,123,725 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers based on resequencing to conduct a dynamic genome-wide association study (GWAS) of coleoptile length (CL) and coleoptile diameter (CD) in 209 natural rice populations. A total of 26 SNP loci were detected in these two phenotypes, of which 5 overlapped with previously reported loci (S1_ 39674301, S6_ 20797781, S7_ 18722403, S8_ 9946213, S11_ 19165397), and two sites were detected repeatedly at different time points (S3_ 24689629 and S5_ 27918754). We suggest that these 7 loci (-log10 (P) value > 7.3271) are the key sites that affect AG tolerance. To screen the candidate genes more effectively, we sequenced the transcriptome of the flooding-tolerant variety R151 in six key stages, including anaerobic (AN) and the oxygen conversion point (AN-A), and obtained high-quality differential expression profiles. Four reliable candidate genes were identified: Os01g0911700 (OsVP1), Os05g0560900 (OsGA2ox8), Os05g0562200 (OsDi19-1) and Os06g0548200. Then qRT-PCR and LC-MS/ MS targeting metabolite detection technology were used to further verify that the up-regulated expression of these four candidate genes was closely related to AG.  Conclusion: The four novel candidate genes were associated with gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) regulation and cell wall metabolism under oxygen-deficiency conditions and promoted coleoptile elongation while avoiding adverse effects, allowing the coleoptile to obtain oxygen, escape the low-oxygen environment and germinate rapidly. The results of this study improve our understanding of the genetic basis of AG in rice seeds, which is conducive to the selection of flooding-tolerant varieties suitable for direct seeding.
