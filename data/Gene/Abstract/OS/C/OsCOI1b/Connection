OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	OsCOI1b	Mutation of Oryza sativa CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1b (OsCOI1b) delays leaf senescence.	The Arabidopsis genome harbors a single COI gene, but the rice (Oryza sativa) genome harbors three COI homologs, OsCOI1a, OsCOI1b, and OsCOI2
OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	OsCOI1b	Mutation of Oryza sativa CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1b (OsCOI1b) delays leaf senescence.	The Arabidopsis coi1-1 plants containing 35S:OsCOI1a or 35S:OsCOI1b rescued the delayed leaf senescence during dark incubation, suggesting that both OsCOI1a and OsCOI1b are required for promoting leaf senescence in rice
OsCOI1b	OsCOI2	Mutation of Oryza sativa CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1b (OsCOI1b) delays leaf senescence.	The Arabidopsis genome harbors a single COI gene, but the rice (Oryza sativa) genome harbors three COI homologs, OsCOI1a, OsCOI1b, and OsCOI2
OsCOI1b	OSK1	A bacterial kinase phosphorylates OSK1 to suppress stomatal immunity in rice.	 Intriguingly, OSK1 phosphorylation at Ser(53) by XopC2 exclusively increases the binding affinity of OSK1 to the jasmonate receptor OsCOI1b, and specifically enhances the ubiquitination and degradation of JAZ transcription repressors and plant disease susceptibility through inhibiting stomatal immunity
