Plant Cell Physiol-2009-Jang-1479-92.pdf	Survey of rice proteins interacting with OsFCA and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant Signaling Network Research Center, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Korea.	The FCA protein is involved in controlling flowering time and plays more general roles in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing in Arabidopsis. It contains two RNA-binding domains and a WW domain. The FCA protein interacts with FY, a polyadenylation factor, via its WW domain. We previously characterized a rice gene, OsFCA, which was homologous to FCA. Here, we found that the OsFCA protein could interact through its WW domain with the following proteins: OsFY, a protein containing a CID domain present in RNA-processing factors such as Pcf11 and Nrd1; a protein similar to splicing factor SF1; a protein similar to FUSE splicing factor; and OsMADS8. The FY protein is associated with the 3' end processing machinery in Arabidopsis. Thus, we examined interactions between OsFY and the rice homologs (OsCstF-50, -64 and -77) of the AtCstF-50, -64 and -77 proteins. We found that OsFY could bind OsCstF50, whereas the OsCstF77 protein could bridge the interaction between OsCstF50 and OsCstF64. Taken together, our data suggest that OsFCA could interact with several proteins other than OsFY through its WW domain and may play several roles in rice.
