tpj12106.pdf	OsCYP2, a chaperone involved in degradation of auxin-responsive proteins, plays crucial roles in rice lateral root initiation	2013	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Auxin plays a pivotal role in many facets of plant development. It acts by inducing the interaction between auxin-responsive [auxin (AUX)/indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)] proteins and the ubiquitin protein ligase SCF(TIR) to promote the degradation of the AUX/IAA proteins. Other cofactors and chaperones that participate in auxin signaling remain to be identified. Here, we characterized rice (Oryza sativa) plants with mutations in a cyclophilin gene (OsCYP2). cyp2 mutants showed defects in auxin responses and exhibited a variety of auxin-related growth defects in the root. In cyp2 mutants, lateral root initiation was blocked after nuclear migration but before the first anticlinal division of the pericycle cell. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down results revealed an association between OsCYP2 and the co-chaperone Suppressor of G2 allele of skp1 (OsSGT1). Luciferase complementation imaging assays further supported this interaction. Similar to previous findings in an Arabidopsis thaliana SGT1 mutant (atsgt1b), degradation of AUX/IAA proteins was retarded in cyp2 mutants treated with exogenous 1-naphthylacetic acid. Our results suggest that OsCYP2 participates in auxin signal transduction by interacting with OsSGT1.

Cyclophilin 2 (OsCyp2) is a cytosolic member of immunophilin family from rice. We have isolated its full length cDNA (1,056 bp) with an open reading frame of 519 bp encoding a polypeptide of 172 amino acids and an estimated pI of 8.61. Peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of the protein was determined using N-succinyl-ala-ala-pro-phe-p-nitroanilidine as peptide substrate. It has a catalytic efficiency (K (cat)/K (m)) of 4.5 x 10(6)/(mol/l)/s, which is comparable to known cyclophilins from plants. Its activity is specifically inhibited by cyclosporin A, a macrolide drug inhibitor of cyclophilins. Transcript analysis showed it to be a developmentally and differentially regulated gene; showing changes in abundance at seedling, tillering and heading stage under non-stress and salinity stress conditions. Expression of OsCyp2 enhances the ability of Escherichia coli to survive under diverse abiotic stresses viz. salinity, high temperature, osmotic stress (mannitol) and oxidative stress (H(2)O(2)). OsCyp2 was able to complement the yeast mutant lacking native Cyp2 and also improved the growth of wild type yeast under above-mentioned stress conditions. Based on these results, we propose that OsCyp2 may serve as a 'suitable candidate' for raising transgenic plants for enhanced multiple abiotic stress tolerance.

Comparative proteomic analysis of hybrid rice shoot proteins from Shanyou 10 seedlings, a salt-tolerant hybrid variety, and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings, a salt-sensitive hybrid variety, was performed to identify new components involved in salt-stress signaling.
NA	Expression of a cyclophilin OsCyp2-P isolated from a salt-tolerant landrace of rice in tobacco alleviates stress via ion homeostasis and limiting ROS accumulation.	2014	Funct Integr Genomics	Stress Physiology and Molecular Biology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, 110067, India.	Cyclophilins are a set of ubiquitous proteins present in all subcellular compartments, involved in a wide variety of cellular processes. Comparative bioinformatics analysis of the rice and Arabidopsis genomes led us to identify novel putative cyclophilin gene family members in both the genomes not reported previously. We grouped cyclophilin members with similar molecular weight and subtypes together in the phylogenetic tree which indicated their co-evolution in rice and Arabidopsis. We also characterized a rice cyclophilin gene, OsCyp2-P (Os02g0121300), isolated from a salinity-tolerant landrace, Pokkali. Publicly available massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) and microarray data, besides our quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) data suggest that transcript abundance of OsCyp2-P is regulated under different stress conditions in a developmental and organ specific manner. Ectopic expression of OsCyp2-P imparted multiple abiotic stress tolerance to transgenic tobacco plants as evidenced by higher root length, shoot length, chlorophyll content, and K(+)/Na(+) ratio under stress conditions. Transgenic plants also showed reduced lipid peroxidase content, electrolyte leakage, and superoxide content under stress conditions suggesting better ion homeostasis than WT plants. Localization studies confirmed that OsCyp2-P is localized in both cytosol and nucleus, indicating its possible interaction with several other proteins. The overall results suggest the explicit role of OsCyp2-P in bestowing multiple abiotic stress tolerance at the whole plant level. OsCyp2-P operates via reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and ion homeostasis and thus is a promising candidate gene for enhancing multiple abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants.
NA	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.	2015	Nat Commun	1] State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China [2] University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	In plants, auxin signalling is initiated by the auxin-promoted interaction between the auxin receptor TIR1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors, which are subsequently degraded by the proteasome. Gain-of-function mutations in the highly conserved domain II of Aux/IAAs abolish the TIR1-Aux/IAA interaction and thus cause an auxin-resistant phenotype. Here we show that peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of rice OsIAA11 catalysed by LATERAL ROOTLESS2 (LRT2), a cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, directly regulates the stability of OsIAA11. NMR spectroscopy reveals that LRT2 efficiently catalyses the cis/trans isomerization of OsIAA11. The lrt2 mutation reduces OsTIR1-OsIAA11 interaction and consequently causes the accumulation of a higher level of OsIAA11 protein. Moreover, knockdown of the OsIAA11 expression partially rescues the lrt2 mutant phenotype in lateral root development. Together, these results illustrate cyclophilin-catalysed peptidyl-prolyl isomerization promotes Aux/IAA degradation, as a mechanism regulating auxin signalling.
NA	A zinc finger protein, interacted with cyclophilin, affects root development via IAA pathway in rice.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	Institute of Crop Science and Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Crop Germplasm, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058,, China.	The plant hormone auxin plays a crucial role in lateral root development. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying lateral root formation, an auxin-responsive gene OsCYP2 (Os02g0121300) was characterized from rice. Compared to the wild type, OsCYP2-RNAi (RNA interference) lines exhibited distinctive defects in lateral root development. Yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pull-down results confirmed that OsCYP2 interacted with a C2HC-type zinc finger protein (OsZFP, Os01g0252900) which is located in the rice nucleus. T2 OsZFP-RNAi lines had significantly fewer lateral roots than did wild-type plants, which suggests a role for OsCYP2 and OsZFP in regulating lateral root development. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of certain Aux/IAA (auxin/indole-3-acetic acid) genes was altered in OsCYP2- and OsZFP-RNAi lines in response to IAA. These findings imply that OsCYP2 and OsZFP participate in IAA signal pathways controlling lateral root development. More importantly, OsIAA11 showed functional redundancy not only in OsCYP2-RNAi lines but also in OsZFP-RNAi lines, which provides important clues for the elucidation of mechanisms controlling lateral root development in response to auxin.
NA	Quantification of reaction cycle parameters for an essential molecular switch in an auxin-responsive transcription circuit in rice.	2019	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853.	Protein-based molecular switches play critical roles in biological processes. The importance of the prolyl cis-trans switch is underscored by the ubiquitous presence of peptidyl prolyl isomerases such as cyclophilins that accelerate the intrinsically slow isomerization rate. In rice, a tryptophan-proline (W-P) cis-trans switch in transcription repressor protein OsIAA11 along with its associated cyclophilin LRT2 are essential components in a negative feedback gene regulation circuit that controls lateral root initiation in response to the plant hormone auxin. Importantly, no quantitative characterizations of the individual (microscopic) thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for any cyclophilin-catalyzed W-P isomerization have been reported. Here we present NMR studies that determine and independently validate these parameters for LRT2 catalysis of the W-P motif in OsIAA11, providing predictive power for understanding the role of this switch in the auxin-responsive circuit and the resulting lateral rootless phenotype in rice. We show that the observed isomerization rate is linearly dependent on LRT2 concentration but is independent of OsIAA11 concentration over a wide range, and LRT2 is optimally tuned to maintain OsIAA11 at its cis-trans equilibrium to supply the slower downstream cis-specific proteasomal degradation with maximal OsIAA11 substrate. This indicates that accelerating the LRT2-catalyzed isomerization would not accelerate OsIAA degradation, whereas decreasing this rate via targeted mutation could reveal relationships between circuit dynamics and lateral root development. Moreover, we show that sequences flanking the highly conserved Aux/IAA W-P motif do not impact LRT2 catalysis, suggesting that the parameters determined here are broadly applicable across highly conserved cyclophilins and their Aux/IAA targets.
