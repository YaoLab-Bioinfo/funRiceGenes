NA	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell	China Rice Research Insititute CITY: Hangzhou China [CN].	Cullin3-based RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRL3), composed of Cullin3 (CUL3), RBX1, and BTB proteins, are involved in plant immunity but the function of CUL3 in the process is largely unknown. Here, we show that rice OsCUL3a is important for the regulation of cell death and immunity. The rice lesion mimic mutant oscul3a displays a significant increase in the accumulation of flg22- and chitin-induced reactive oxygen species, and in pathogenesis-related gene expression as well as resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. We cloned the OsCUL3a gene via a map-based strategy and found that the lesion mimic phenotype of oscul3a is associated with the early termination of OsCUL3a protein. Interaction assays showed that OsCUL3a interacts with both OsRBX1a and OsRBX1b to form a multi-subunit CRL in rice. Strikingly, OsCUL3a interacts with and degrades OsNPR1, which acts as a positive regulator of cell death in rice. Accumulation of OsNPR1 protein is greater in the oscul3a mutant than in the wild type. Furthermore, the oscul3a osnpr1 double mutant does not exhibit the lesion mimic phenotype of the oscul3a mutant. Our data demonstrate that OsCUL3a negatively regulates cell death and immunity by degrading OsNPR1 in rice.
NA	OsCUL3a-associated molecular switches have functions in cell metabolism, cell death, and disease resistance.	2020	J Agric Food Chem	Fail	This study applies parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) proteomics and CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to identify relationships between cell metabolism, cell death, and disease resistance. In oscul3a (oscullin3a) mutants, OsCUL3a-associated molecular switches are responsible for disrupted cell metabolism that leads to increased total lipid content in rice grain, a late accumulation of H2O2 in leaves, enhanced Xoo disease resistance, and suppressed panicle and first internode growth. In oscul3a mutants, PRM confirmed up-regulated molecular switch proteins include lipoxygenases (CM-LOX1 and CM-LOX2), suggesting a novel connection between ferroptosis and rice lesion mimic formation. Rice immunity-associated proteins OsNPR1 and OsNPR3 were shown to interact with each other and have opposing regulatory effects based on the cell death phenotype of osnpr1/oscul3a and osnpr3/oscul3a double mutants. Together, these results describe a network that regulates plant growth, disease resistance, and grain quality that includes the E3 ligase OsCUL3a, cell metabolism-associated molecular switches, and immunity switches OsNPR1 and OsNPR3.
