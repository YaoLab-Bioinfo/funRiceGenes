OsCUL3a	OsNPR1|NH1	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.
OsCUL3a	OsNPR1|NH1	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.	Strikingly, OsCUL3a interacts with and degrades OsNPR1, which acts as a positive regulator of cell death in rice
OsCUL3a	OsNPR1|NH1	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.	Accumulation of OsNPR1 protein is greater in the oscul3a mutant than in the wild type
OsCUL3a	OsNPR1|NH1	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.	Furthermore, the oscul3a osnpr1 double mutant does not exhibit the lesion mimic phenotype of the oscul3a mutant
OsCUL3a	OsNPR1|NH1	OsCUL3a Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Immunity by Degrading OsNPR1 in Rice.	Our data demonstrate that OsCUL3a negatively regulates cell death and immunity by degrading OsNPR1 in rice
NH3|OsNPR3	OsCUL3a	OsCUL3a-associated molecular switches have functions in cell metabolism, cell death, and disease resistance.	 Together, these results describe a network that regulates plant growth, disease resistance, and grain quality that includes the E3 ligase OsCUL3a, cell metabolism-associated molecular switches, and immunity switches OsNPR1 and OsNPR3
