Ehd3	OsTrx1|SDG723	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	We demonstrated that the plant homeodomain motif of OsTrx1 binds to native histone H3 from the calf thymus and that OsTrx1 binds to Ehd3 through the region between the plant homeodomain and SET domains
Ghd7	OsTrx1|SDG723	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
Ghd7	OsTrx1|SDG723	Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3	Because Trx group proteins form a complex with other proteins to modify the chromatin structure of target genes, we investigated whether OsTrx1 interacts with a previously identified protein that functions upstream of Ghd7
OsTrx1|SDG723	OsWDR5a	The COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle branching in rice.	 Plants in which OsWDR5a or OsTrx1 expression was decreased by RNA interference produced fewer secondary branches and less grain, and exhibited a delayed heading date under long-day and short-day conditions, whereas loss of OsWDR5a function resulted in embryo lethality
