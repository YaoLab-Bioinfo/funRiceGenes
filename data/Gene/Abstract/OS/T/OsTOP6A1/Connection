MER3|RCK	OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice	The crossover protein, MER3, isn't efficiently assembled onto chromosomes and the lack of bivalent suggests that crossovers are also affected in the absence of OsSPO11-1
OsCOM1	OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
MER3|RCK	OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
OsRad21-4|OsREC8	OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	ZEP1	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	PAIR2	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	OsTOP6B	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	OsTOP6A3	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1
OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	TOP6A2|OsTOP6A2	Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants	Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that the full-length OsTOP6B protein interacts with both OsTOP6A2 and OsTOP6A3, but not with OsTOP6A1
OsMTOPVIB	OsSPO11-1|OsTOP6A1	OsMTOPVIB is required for meiotic bipolar spindle assembly.	 We further revealed that the mono-orientation of sister kinetochores was prevalent in OsmtopVIB, whereas biorientation of sister kinetochores was frequently observed in Osspo11-1, pair2, and crc1 In addition, mutations of the cohesion subunit OsREC8 resulted in biorientation of sister kinetochores as well as bipolar spindles even in the background of OsmtopVIB Therefore, we propose that biorientation of the kinetochore is required for bipolar spindle assembly in the absence of homologous recombination
