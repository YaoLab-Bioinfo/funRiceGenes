Ostrxm	dwarf	Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants	RNA interference (RNAi) of Ostrxm resulted in rice plants with developmental defects, including semidwarfism, pale-green leaves, abnormal chloroplast structure, and reduced carotenoid and chlorophyll content
Ostrxm	photosynthesis	Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants	Two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis showed that the levels of several chloroplast proteins critical for photosynthesis and biogenesis were significantly decreased in Ostrxm RNAi plants
Ostrxm	chloroplast	Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants	Ostrxm was localized in chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells, and the recombinant protein showed dithiothreitol-dependent insulin beta-chain reduction activity in vitro
Ostrxm	chloroplast	Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants	RNA interference (RNAi) of Ostrxm resulted in rice plants with developmental defects, including semidwarfism, pale-green leaves, abnormal chloroplast structure, and reduced carotenoid and chlorophyll content
Ostrxm	chloroplast	Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants	Two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis showed that the levels of several chloroplast proteins critical for photosynthesis and biogenesis were significantly decreased in Ostrxm RNAi plants
Ostrxm	chloroplast	Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants	The pleiotropic effects of Ostrxm RNAi suggest that Ostrxm plays an important role in the redox regulation of chloroplast target proteins involved in diverse physiological functions
Ostrxm	reactive oxygen species	Repressed OsMESL expression triggers reactive oxygen species mediated broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice	 Protein interaction experiments revealed that OsMESL affects reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation by interacting with thioredoxin OsTrxm in rice
