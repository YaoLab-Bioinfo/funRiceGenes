OsTAR1	OsTARL2	TILLERING AND SMALL GRAIN 1 dominates the tryptophan aminotransferase family required for local auxin biosynthesis in rice.	 Meanwhile, deletion of the TSG1 homologs OsTAR1, OsTARL1, and OsTARL2 caused no obvious changes, although the phenotype of the TSG1/OsTAR1 double mutant was intensified and infertile, suggesting gene redundancy in the rice tryptophan aminotransferase family
OsTAR1	OsTARL2	TILLERING AND SMALL GRAIN 1 dominates the tryptophan aminotransferase family required for local auxin biosynthesis in rice.	 Interestingly, TSG1 and OsTAR1, but not OsTARL1 and OsTARL2, displayed marked aminotransferase activity
OsTAR1	OsTARL2	TILLERING AND SMALL GRAIN 1 dominates the tryptophan aminotransferase family required for local auxin biosynthesis in rice.	 Meanwhile, subcellular localization was identified as the endoplasmic reticulum, while phylogenetic analysis revealed functional divergence of TSG1 and OsTAR1 from OsTARL1 and OsTARL2
