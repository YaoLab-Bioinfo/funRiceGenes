OsTFX1|OsbZIP73	bacterial blight	Two type III effector genes of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae control the induction of the host genes OsTFIIA 1 and OsTFX1 during bacterial blight of rice	Two type III effector genes of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae control the induction of the host genes OsTFIIA 1 and OsTFX1 during bacterial blight of rice
OsTFX1|OsbZIP73	transcription factor	Two type III effector genes of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae control the induction of the host genes OsTFIIA 1 and OsTFX1 during bacterial blight of rice	Here, we show that PXO99(A) affects the expression of two additional genes in a type III secretion system-dependent manner, one encoding a bZIP transcription factor (OsTFX1) and the other the small subunit of the transcription factor IIA located on chromosome 1 (OsTFIIAgamma1)
