OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells.	Among the OsTGAP1-interacting protein candidates, a TGA factor OsbZIP79 was investigated to verify its physical interaction with OsTGAP1 and involvement in the regulation of phytoalexin production
OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells.	An in vitro pull-down assay demonstrated that OsTGAP1 and OsbZIP79 exhibited a heterodimeric as well as a homodimeric interaction
OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells.	A bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis also showed the interaction between OsTGAP1 and OsbZIP79 in vivo
OsbZIP79|OsTGA911	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Overexpression of the bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP79 suppresses the production of diterpenoid phytoalexin in rice cells.	These results suggest that OsbZIP79 functions as a negative regulator of phytoalexin production triggered by a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor in rice cells, although it remains open under which conditions OsbZIP79 can work with OsTGAP1
OsDXS|OsDXS3	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Identification of target genes of the bZIP transcription factor OsTGAP1, whose overexpression causes elicitor-induced hyperaccumulation of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice cells.	A subsequent transactivation assay further confirmed the direct regulation of OsDXS3 expression by OsTGAP1, but other MEP pathway genes were not included among the OsTGAP1 target genes
OsDTS2|OsKSL4|OsKS4	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	OsTGAP1 is responsible for JA-inducible diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice roots with biological impacts on allelopathic interaction.	 Reporter analysis in planta revealed that OsTGAP1 activated the promoters of OsDXS3 and momilactone biosynthetic gene OsKSL4, presumably through binding to the TGACGT motif
