OsbZIP52|RISBZ5	OsTPP1	bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice	Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines
OsLEA3|OsLEA3-1	OsTPP1	bZIP transcription factor OsbZIP52/RISBZ5: a potential negative regulator of cold and drought stress response in rice	Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines
OsTPP1	OsTPP2	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	Here we report that OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 are the two major trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase genes expressed in vegetative tissues of rice
OsTPP1	OsTPP2	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	Similar to results obtained from our previous OsTPP1 study, complementation analysis of a yeast trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase mutant and activity measurement of the recombinant protein demonstrated that OsTPP2 encodes a functional trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzyme
OsTPP1	OsTPP2	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	Enzymatic characterization of recombinant OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 revealed stringent substrate specificity for trehalose 6-phosphate and about 10 times lower K(m) values for trehalose 6-phosphate as compared with trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase enzymes from microorganisms
OsTPP1	OsTPP2	Biochemical characterization of rice trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatases supports distinctive functions of these plant enzymes	OsTPP1 and OsTPP2 also clearly contrasted with microbial enzymes, in that they are generally unstable, almost completely losing activity when subjected to heat treatment at 50 degrees C for 4 min
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsTPP1	OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate OsTPP1 and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.	OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate OsTPP1 and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsTPP1	OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate OsTPP1 and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.	 Under chilling stress, active OsMAPK3 phosphorylates OsbHLH002, leading to accumulation of phospho-OsbHLH002, which promotes OsTPP1 expression and increases trehalose content and resistance to chilling damage
OsMAPK33|OsMAPK3	OsTPP1	OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate OsTPP1 and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.	<U+00A0>Taken together, these results indicate that OsbHLH002 is phosphorylated by OsMAPK3, which enhances OsbHLH002 activation to its target OsTPP1 during chilling stress
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsTPP1	OsTPP1 regulates seed germination through the crosstalk with abscisic acid in rice	 In addition, ABA responsive genes, especially OsABI5, were invoved in OsTPP1 mediated seed germination
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	OsTPP1	OsTPP1 regulates seed germination through the crosstalk with abscisic acid in rice	 <U+2022> Further analysis showed that transcription factor of OsGAMYB was an activator of OsTPP1, and expression of OsGAMYB was decreased by both the exogenous and endogenous ABA, subsequently reduced the expression of OsTPP1, which suggested a new signaling pathway required for seed germination in rice
