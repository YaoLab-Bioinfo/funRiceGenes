NA	A bacterial F-box effector suppresses SAR immunity through mediating the proteasomal degradation of OsTrxh2 in rice	2020	Plant Journal	Institute of Integrative Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou, 221116, China.	Plant bacterial pathogens usually cause diseases by secreting and translocating numerous virulence effectors into host cells and suppressing various host immunity pathways. It has been demonstrated that the extensive ubiquitin systems of host cells are frequently interfered with or hijacked by numerous pathogenic bacteria, through various strategies. Some type-III secretion system (T3SS) effectors of plant pathogens have been demonstrated to impersonate the F-box protein (FBP) component of the SKP1/CUL1/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin system for their own benefit. Although numerous putative eukaryotic-like F-box effectors have been screened for different bacterial pathogens by bioinformatics analyses, the targets of most F-box effectors in host immune systems remain unknown. Here, we show that XopI, a putative F-box effector of African Xoo (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) strain BAI3, strongly inhibits the host's OsNPR1-dependent resistance to Xoo. The xopI knockout mutant displays lower virulence in Oryza sativa (rice) than BAI3. Mechanistically, we identify a thioredoxin protein, OsTrxh2, as an XopI-interacting protein in rice. Although OsTrxh2 positively regulates rice immunity by catalyzing the dissociation of OsNPR1 into monomers in rice, the XopI effector serves as an F-box adapter to form an OSK1-XopI-OsTrxh2 interaction complex, and further disrupts OsNPR1-mediated resistance through proteasomal degradation of OsTrxh2. Our results indicate that XopI targets OsTrxh2 and further represses OsNPR1-dependent signaling, thereby subverting systemic acquired resistance (SAR) immunity in rice.
