OsTAR1	OsYUC9	A large increase in IAA during development of rice grains correlates with the expression of tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 and a grain-specific YUCCA	The increase in IAA content was strongly correlated with the expression of putative IAA biosynthesis genes, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and OsTAR1, measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
OsTAR1	OsYUC9	A large increase in IAA during development of rice grains correlates with the expression of tryptophan aminotransferase OsTAR1 and a grain-specific YUCCA	In light of these observations, we hypothesize that IAA production in developing rice grains is controlled via expression of OsTAR1, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and that IAA may be important during starch deposition in addition to its previously suggested role early in grain development

FIB|TSG1	OsTAR1	TILLERING AND SMALL GRAIN 1 dominates the tryptophan aminotransferase family required for local auxin biosynthesis in rice.	 Meanwhile, deletion of the TSG1 homologs OsTAR1, OsTARL1, and OsTARL2 caused no obvious changes, although the phenotype of the TSG1/OsTAR1 double mutant was intensified and infertile, suggesting gene redundancy in the rice tryptophan aminotransferase family
FIB|TSG1	OsTAR1	TILLERING AND SMALL GRAIN 1 dominates the tryptophan aminotransferase family required for local auxin biosynthesis in rice.	 Interestingly, TSG1 and OsTAR1, but not OsTARL1 and OsTARL2, displayed marked aminotransferase activity
FIB|TSG1	OsTAR1	TILLERING AND SMALL GRAIN 1 dominates the tryptophan aminotransferase family required for local auxin biosynthesis in rice.	 Meanwhile, subcellular localization was identified as the endoplasmic reticulum, while phylogenetic analysis revealed functional divergence of TSG1 and OsTAR1 from OsTARL1 and OsTARL2
