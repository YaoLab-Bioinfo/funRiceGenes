OsWRKY24	OsWRKY71	A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells	Third, unlike OsWRKY71, OsWRKY24 is stable upon GA treatment
OsWRKY24	OsWRKY72	Annotations and functional analyses of the rice WRKY gene superfamily reveal positive and negative regulators of abscisic acid signaling in aleurone cells	Using a transient expression system, we have demonstrated that OsWRKY24 and -45 repress ABA induction of the HVA22 promoter-beta-glucuronidase construct, while OsWRKY72 and -77 synergistically interact with ABA to activate this reporter construct
OsDREB4-2|CR250|OsAP2	OsWRKY24	Overexpression of OsAP2 and OsWRKY24 in Arabidopsis results in reduction of plant size.	Overexpression of OsAP2 and OsWRKY24 in Arabidopsis results in reduction of plant size.
OsDREB4-2|CR250|OsAP2	OsWRKY24	Overexpression of OsAP2 and OsWRKY24 in Arabidopsis results in reduction of plant size.	Recently, two rice genes, OsAPETALA2 (OsAP2) and OsWRKY24 have been reported to be positive regulators involved in increased lamina inclination and grain size through cell elongation
