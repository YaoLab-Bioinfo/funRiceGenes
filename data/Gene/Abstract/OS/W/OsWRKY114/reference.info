NA	Rice transcription factor WRKY114 directly regulates the expression of OsPR1a and Chitinase to enhance resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	2020	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju, 54874, South Korea.	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a global staple crop, but its yield is severely threatened by bacterial leaf blight (BLB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The OsWRKY transcription factor family play a central role in innate plant immunity against Xoo, but the various biological functions of a large number of OsWRKYs remain to be understood. We characterized the role of OsWRKY114 against Xoo. OsWRKY114 has transcriptional activity in yeast and localizes in the nucleus. When OsWRKY114 is overexpressed in transgenic plants they show enhanced disease resistance against Xoo compared with wild types. By using genetic- and cell-based functional analyses, we showed OsWRKY114 directly associates with the promoters of OsPR1a and Chitinase and increases the promoter activities. These results suggest that OsWRKY114 enhances the innate immunity of Asian rice against Xoo through direct activation of defense genes that include OsPR1a and chtinase. This is the first report to functionally characterize OsWRKY114 in Xoo infection.
