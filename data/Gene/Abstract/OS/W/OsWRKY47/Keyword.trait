OsWRKY47	blast	Transcriptional Profiling of Rice Early Response to Magnaporthe oryzae Identified OsWRKYs as Important Regulators in Rice Blast Resistance	Overexpressing one of these WRKY genes, OsWRKY47, in transgenic rice plants conferred enhanced resistance against rice blast fungus
OsWRKY47	transcription factor	The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.	The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.
OsWRKY47	transcription factor	The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.	OsWRKY47 is a divergent rice transcription factor belonging to the group II of the WRKY family
OsWRKY47	drought	The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.	A transcriptomic analysis of the drought response of transgenic rice plants expressing P SARK ::IPT, validated by qPCR, indicated that OsWRKY47 expression was induced under drought stress in P SARK ::IPT plants
OsWRKY47	drought	The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.	Phenotypic analysis carried out with transgenic rice plants showed that Oswrky47 mutants displayed higher sensitivity to drought and reduced yield, while plants overexpressing OsWRKY47 were more tolerant
OsWRKY47	stress	The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.	A transcriptomic analysis of the drought response of transgenic rice plants expressing P SARK ::IPT, validated by qPCR, indicated that OsWRKY47 expression was induced under drought stress in P SARK ::IPT plants
OsWRKY47	drought stress	The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.	A transcriptomic analysis of the drought response of transgenic rice plants expressing P SARK ::IPT, validated by qPCR, indicated that OsWRKY47 expression was induced under drought stress in P SARK ::IPT plants
OsWRKY47	drought stress 	The rice transcription factor OsWRKY47 is a positive regulator of the response to water deficit stress.	A transcriptomic analysis of the drought response of transgenic rice plants expressing P SARK ::IPT, validated by qPCR, indicated that OsWRKY47 expression was induced under drought stress in P SARK ::IPT plants
OsWRKY47	transcriptional regulator	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	 In the first transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10 whereas OsWRKY51 acted upstream
OsWRKY47	transcriptional regulator	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	 In the second transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10, and OsWRKY88 acted upstream
