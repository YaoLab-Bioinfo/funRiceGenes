Gibberellins (GA) promote while abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits seed germination and post-germination growth. To address the cross-talk of GA and ABA signaling, we studied two rice WRKY genes (OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71) that are ABA-inducible and GA-repressible in embryos and aleurone cells. Over-expression of these two genes in aleurone cells specifically and synergistically represses induction of the ABA-repressible and GA-inducible Amy32b alpha-amylase promoter reporter construct (Amy32b-GUS) by GA or the GA-inducible transcriptional activator, GAMYB. The physical interactions of OsWRKY71 proteins themselves and that of OsWRKY71 and OsWRKY51 are revealed in the nuclei of aleurone cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Although OsWRKY51 itself does not bind to the Amy32b promoter in vitro, it interacts with OsWRKY71 and enhances the binding affinity of OsWRKY71 to W boxes in the Amy32b promoter. The binding activity of OsWRKY71 is abolished by deleting the C-terminus containing the WRKY domain or substituting the key amino acids in the WRKY motif and the zinc finger region. However, two of these non-DNA-binding mutants are still able to repress GA induction by enhancing the binding affinity of the wild-type DNA-binding OsWRKY71 repressors. In contrast, the third non-DNA-binding mutant enhances GA induction of Amy32b-GUS, by interfering with the binding of the wild-type OsWRKY71 or the OsWRKY71/OsWRKY51 repressing complex. These data demonstrate the synergistic interaction of ABA-inducible WRKY genes in regulating GAMYB-mediated GA signaling in aleurone cells, thereby establishing a novel mechanism for ABA and GA signaling cross-talk.
j.1744-7909.2007.00504.x.pdf	The WRKY Gene Family in Rice (Oryza sativa)	2007	J Integr Plant Biol	Bioinformatics Core, School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA	WRKY genes encode transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of various biological processes. These zinc-finger proteins, especially those members mediating stress responses, are uniquely expanded in plants. To facilitate the study of the evolutionary history and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive search for WRKY genes using HMMER and a Hidden Markov Model that was specifically trained for rice. This work resulted in a comprehensive list of WRKY gene models in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and L. ssp. japonica. Mapping of these genes to individual chromosomes facilitated elimination of the redundant, leading to the identification of 98 WRKY genes in japonica and 102 in indica rice. These genes were further categorized according to the number and structure of their zinc-finger domains. Based on a phylogenetic tree of the conserved WRKY domains and the graphic display of WRKY loci on corresponding indica and japonica chromosomes, we identified possible WRKY gene duplications within, and losses between the two closely related rice subspecies. Also reviewed are the roles of WRKY genes in disease resistance and responses to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, seed development and germination mediated by gibberellins, other developmental processes including senescence, and responses to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid in rice and other plants. The signaling pathways mediating WRKY gene expression are also discussed.
pp1370176.pdf	Annotations and functional analyses of the rice WRKY gene superfamily reveal positive and negative regulators of abscisic acid signaling in aleurone cells	2005	Plant Physiol	Department of Biological Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA.	The WRKY proteins are a superfamily of regulators that control diverse developmental and physiological processes. This family was believed to be plant specific until the recent identification of WRKY genes in nonphotosynthetic eukaryotes. We have undertaken a comprehensive computational analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequences and predicted the structures of 81 OsWRKY genes, 48 of which are supported by full-length cDNA sequences. Eleven OsWRKY proteins contain two conserved WRKY domains, while the rest have only one. Phylogenetic analyses of the WRKY domain sequences provide support for the hypothesis that gene duplication of single- and two-domain WRKY genes, and loss of the WRKY domain, occurred in the evolutionary history of this gene family in rice. The phylogeny deduced from the WRKY domain peptide sequences is further supported by the position and phase of the intron in the regions encoding the WRKY domains. Analyses for chromosomal distributions reveal that 26% of the predicted OsWRKY genes are located on chromosome 1. Among the dozen genes tested, OsWRKY24, -51, -71, and -72 are induced by abscisic acid (ABA) in aleurone cells. Using a transient expression system, we have demonstrated that OsWRKY24 and -45 repress ABA induction of the HVA22 promoter-beta-glucuronidase construct, while OsWRKY72 and -77 synergistically interact with ABA to activate this reporter construct. This study provides a solid base for functional genomics studies of this important superfamily of regulatory genes in monocotyledonous plants and reveals a novel function for WRKY genes, i.e. mediating plant responses to ABA.
NA	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2016	Plant Cell Rep	National Institute of Agricultural Science, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju, 560-500, Korea.	OsWRKY51 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator in defense signaling against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by direct DNA binding to the promoter of defense related gene, OsPR10a. OsWRKY51 in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is induced by exogenous salicylic acid (SA) and inoculation with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). To examine the role of OsWRKY51 in the defense response of rice, we generated OsWRKY51 overexpressing and underexpressing transgenic rice plants. OsWRKY51-overexpressing transgenic rice lines were more resistant to Xoo and showed greater expression of defense-related genes than wild-type (WT) plants, while OsWRKY51-underexpressing lines were more susceptible to Xoo and showed less expression of defense-associated genes than WT plants. Transgenic lines overexpressing OsWRKY51 showed growth retardation compared to WT plants. In contrast, transgenic lines underexpressing OsWRKY51 by RNA interference showed similar plant height with WT plants. Transient expression of OsWRKY51-green fluorescent protein fusion protein in rice protoplasts revealed that OsWRKY51 was localized in the nucleus. OsWRKY51 bound to the W-box and WLE1 elements of the OsPR10a promoter. Based on these results, we suggest that OsWRKY51 is a positive transcriptional regulator of defense signaling and has direct DNA binding ability to the promoter of OsPR10a, although it is reported to be a negative regulator in GA signaling.
NA	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	2020	J Exp Bot	  National Institute of Agricultural Science, Rural Development Administration, Jeonju, Korea.	WRKY proteins play essential roles as negative or positive regulators of pathogen defense. This study explored the roles of different OsWRKY proteins in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection in rice. Assays of disease in OsWRKY10KD and OsWRKY88KD lines following infection with an incompatible Xoo race, which induced Xa1-mediated resistance in wild-type plants, showed that OsWRKY10 and OsWRKY88 were positive regulators of Xa1-mediated resistance. OsWRKY10 also acted as a positive regulator in basal defense by directly or indirectly activating transcription of defense-related genes. OsWRKY10 activated the OsPR1a promoter by binding to specific WRKY binding sites. Two transcriptional regulatory cascades of OsWRKY10 were identified in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance. In the first transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10 whereas OsWRKY51 acted upstream. OsWRKY10 activated OsPR1a in two distinct ways: by binding to its promoter and, at the same time, by indirect activation through OsWRKY47. In the second transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10, and OsWRKY88 acted upstream. These OsWRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades played important roles in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance to enable the mounting of a rapid immune response against pathogens.
