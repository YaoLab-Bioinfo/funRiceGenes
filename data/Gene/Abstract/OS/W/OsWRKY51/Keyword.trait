OsWRKY51	 ga 	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	To address the cross-talk of GA and ABA signaling, we studied two rice WRKY genes (OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71) that are ABA-inducible and GA-repressible in embryos and aleurone cells
OsWRKY51	 ga 	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	In contrast, the third non-DNA-binding mutant enhances GA induction of Amy32b-GUS, by interfering with the binding of the wild-type OsWRKY71 or the OsWRKY71/OsWRKY51 repressing complex
OsWRKY51	 ABA 	Interactions of two abscisic-acid induced WRKY genes in repressing gibberellin signaling in aleurone cells	To address the cross-talk of GA and ABA signaling, we studied two rice WRKY genes (OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY71) that are ABA-inducible and GA-repressible in embryos and aleurone cells
OsWRKY51	growth	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	Transgenic lines overexpressing OsWRKY51 showed growth retardation compared to WT plants
OsWRKY51	defense	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	OsWRKY51 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator in defense signaling against Xanthomonas oryzae pv
OsWRKY51	defense	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	To examine the role of OsWRKY51 in the defense response of rice, we generated OsWRKY51 overexpressing and underexpressing transgenic rice plants
OsWRKY51	defense	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	Based on these results, we suggest that OsWRKY51 is a positive transcriptional regulator of defense signaling and has direct DNA binding ability to the promoter of OsPR10a, although it is reported to be a negative regulator in GA signaling

OsWRKY51	 ga 	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	Based on these results, we suggest that OsWRKY51 is a positive transcriptional regulator of defense signaling and has direct DNA binding ability to the promoter of OsPR10a, although it is reported to be a negative regulator in GA signaling
OsWRKY51	height	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	In contrast, transgenic lines underexpressing OsWRKY51 by RNA interference showed similar plant height with WT plants
OsWRKY51	plant height	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	In contrast, transgenic lines underexpressing OsWRKY51 by RNA interference showed similar plant height with WT plants
OsWRKY51	nucleus	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	Transient expression of OsWRKY51-green fluorescent protein fusion protein in rice protoplasts revealed that OsWRKY51 was localized in the nucleus
OsWRKY51	GA	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	Based on these results, we suggest that OsWRKY51 is a positive transcriptional regulator of defense signaling and has direct DNA binding ability to the promoter of OsPR10a, although it is reported to be a negative regulator in GA signaling
OsWRKY51	transcriptional regulator	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	OsWRKY51 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator in defense signaling against Xanthomonas oryzae pv
OsWRKY51	transcriptional regulator	OsWRKY51, a rice transcription factor, functions as a positive regulator in defense response against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	Based on these results, we suggest that OsWRKY51 is a positive transcriptional regulator of defense signaling and has direct DNA binding ability to the promoter of OsPR10a, although it is reported to be a negative regulator in GA signaling
OsWRKY51	transcriptional regulator	WRKY10 transcriptional regulatory cascades in rice are involved in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance 	 In the first transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of OsWRKY10 whereas OsWRKY51 acted upstream
