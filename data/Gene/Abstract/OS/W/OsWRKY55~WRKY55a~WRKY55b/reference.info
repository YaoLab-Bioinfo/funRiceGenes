WRKY transcription factors have many regulatory roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we isolated a rice WRKY gene (OsWRKY31) that is induced by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and auxin. This gene encodes a polypeptide of 211 amino-acid residues and belongs to a subgroup of the rice WRKY gene family that probably originated after the divergence of monocot and dicot plants. OsWRKY31 was found to be localized to the nucleus of onion epidermis cells to transiently express OsWRKY31-eGFP fusion protein. Analysis of OsWRKY31 and its mutants fused with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain indicated that OsWRKY31 has transactivation activity in yeast. Overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene was found to enhance resistance against infection with M. grisea, and the transgenic lines exhibited reduced lateral root formation and elongation compared with wild-type and RNAi plants. The lines with overexpression showed constitutive expression of many defense-related genes, such as PBZ1 and OsSci2, as well as early auxin-response genes, such as OsIAA4 and OsCrl1 genes. Furthermore, the plants with overexpression were less sensitive to exogenously supplied IBA, NAA and 2,4-D at high concentrations, suggesting that overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene might alter the auxin response or transport. These results also suggest that OsWRKY31 might be a common component in the signal transduction pathways of the auxin response and the defense response in rice.
j.1744-7909.2007.00504.x.pdf	The WRKY Gene Family in Rice (Oryza sativa)	2007	J Integr Plant Biol	Bioinformatics Core, School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada 89154, USA	WRKY genes encode transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of various biological processes. These zinc-finger proteins, especially those members mediating stress responses, are uniquely expanded in plants. To facilitate the study of the evolutionary history and functions of this supergene family, we performed an exhaustive search for WRKY genes using HMMER and a Hidden Markov Model that was specifically trained for rice. This work resulted in a comprehensive list of WRKY gene models in Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and L. ssp. japonica. Mapping of these genes to individual chromosomes facilitated elimination of the redundant, leading to the identification of 98 WRKY genes in japonica and 102 in indica rice. These genes were further categorized according to the number and structure of their zinc-finger domains. Based on a phylogenetic tree of the conserved WRKY domains and the graphic display of WRKY loci on corresponding indica and japonica chromosomes, we identified possible WRKY gene duplications within, and losses between the two closely related rice subspecies. Also reviewed are the roles of WRKY genes in disease resistance and responses to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, seed development and germination mediated by gibberellins, other developmental processes including senescence, and responses to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid in rice and other plants. The signaling pathways mediating WRKY gene expression are also discussed.
NA	Rice Transcription Factor OsWRKY55 Is Involved in the Drought Response and Regulation of Plant Growth 	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Jilin Province Engineering Laboratory of Plant Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science, Jilin University, Changchun 130062, China.	WRKY transcription factors (TFs) have been reported to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses and regulate plant growth and development. However, the molecular mechanisms of WRKY TFs involved in drought stress and regulating plant height in rice remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsWRKY55 (OsWRKY55-OE) exhibited reduced drought resistance. The OsWRKY55-OE lines showed faster water loss and greater accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide radical (O2-¡¤) compared to wild-type (WT) plants under drought conditions. OsWRKY55 was expressed in various tissues and was induced by drought and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Through yeast two-hybrid assays, we found that OsWRKY55 interacted with four mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that could be induced by drought, including OsMPK7, OsMPK9, OsMPK20-1, and OsMPK20-4. The activation effects of the four OsMPKs on OsWRKY55 transcriptional activity were demonstrated by a GAL4-dependent chimeric transactivation assay in rice protoplasts. Furthermore, OsWRKY55 was able to reduce plant height under normal conditions by decreasing the cell size. In addition, based on a dual luciferase reporter assay, OsWRKY55 was shown to bind to the promoter of OsAP2-39 through a yeast one-hybrid assay and positively regulate OsAP2-39 expression. These results suggest that OsWRKY55 plays a critical role in responses to drought stress and the regulation of plant height in rice, further providing valuable information for crop improvement.
