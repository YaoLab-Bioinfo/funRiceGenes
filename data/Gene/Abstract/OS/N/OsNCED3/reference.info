1-s2.0-S0168945209002623-main.pdf	Ectopic expression of rice OsNCED3 in Arabidopsis increases ABA level and alters leaf morphology	2010	Plant Science	Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica, 128, Sect 2, Academia Rd, Nankang, Taipei 115, Taiwan, ROC	In higher plants, many genes are involved in the abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthetic pathway. Of these, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) encodes what is considered to be the key enzyme. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ectopically expressing a monocot rice NCED gene, OsNCED3, in dicot Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. We showed that OsNCED3 is functionally active in dicot Arabidopsis plants since the ectopic expression of OsNCED3 successfully complements the 129B08/nced3 mutant phenotype. Furthermore, overexpression of OsNCED3 in wild-type Arabidopsis plants results in increased accumulation of ABA, reduced relative water loss, delayed seed germination, and greater drought tolerance relative to that of wild-type. Additionally, we observed that seed ABA content and germination patterns are similar between wild-type and the 129B08/nced3 mutant, suggesting functional redundancy or differential spatial expression of other NCED gene family members. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing the monocot OsNCED3 gene in a wild-type background result in a smaller and rounder leaf shape and midvein. The data suggest that, in addition to ABA biosynthesis, the monocot OsNCED3 gene may have additional functions in shaping leaf morphology and vascular bundle development in Arabidopsis.
10.1007-s00425-013-1853-9.pdf	Phosphorylation of D-allose by hexokinase involved in regulation of OsABF1 expression for growth inhibition in Oryza sativa L	2013	Planta	Faculty of Agriculture, Rare Sugar Research Center, and Gene Research Center, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795, Japan.	We previously reported that a rare sugar D-allose, which is the D-glucose epimer at C3, inhibits the gibberellin-dependent responses such as elongation of the second leaf sheath and induction of alpha-amylase in embryo-less half seeds in rice (Fukumoto et al. 2011). D-Allose suppresses expressions of gibberellin-responsive genes downstream of SLR1 protein in the gibberellin-signaling through hexokinase (HXK)-dependent pathway. In this study, we discovered that D-allose induced expression of ABA-related genes including OsNCED1-3 and OsABA8ox1-3 in rice. Interestingly, D-allose also up-regulated expression of OsABF1, encoding a conserved bZIP transcription factor in ABA signaling, in rice. The D-allose-induced expression of OsABF1 was diminished by a hexokinase inhibitor, D-mannoheptulose (MNH). Consistently, D-allose also inhibited Arabidopsis growth, but failed to trigger growth retardation in the glucose-insensitive2 (gin2) mutant, which is a loss-of-function mutant of the glucose sensor AtHXK1. D-Allose activated AtABI5 expression in transgenic gin2 over-expressing wild-type AtHXK1 but not in gin2 over-expressing the catalytic mutant AtHXK1(S177A), indicating that the D-allose phosphorylation by HXK to D-allose 6-phosphate (A6P) is the first step for the up-regulation of AtABI5 gene expression as well as D-allose-induced growth inhibition. Moreover, overexpression of OsABF1 showed increased sensitivity to D-allose in rice. These findings indicated that the phosphorylation of D-allose at C6 by hexokinase is essential and OsABF1 is involved in the signal transduction for D-allose-induced growth inhibition.
23.pdf	ABA controls H(2)O(2) accumulation through the induction of OsCATB in rice leaves under water stress	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biology, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China.	The production of both ABA and H(2)O(2) is induced by drought and can act as signals under stress conditions. We investigated the relationships between ABA, H(2)O(2) and catalase (CAT) in rice leaves when rice seedlings were treated with polyethylene glycol as water stress treatment. As a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, OsNCED3 was significantly induced in rice by water stress treatment and such induction preceded the rapid increase in ABA. Water stress inhibited the expression of CATA and CATC but substantially enhanced the expression of CATB. Exogenously applied ABA promoted the expression of CATB also and inhibited the expression of CATC in a concentration-dependent manner. When ABA production was inhibited by using ABA biosynthesis inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid and tungstate, expression of CATB was also subdued while CATC was enhanced under the water stress. Accumulation of H(2)O(2) was also reduced when endogenous ABA production was inhibited and showed a correlation with the total activity of catalases. Our results suggest that water stress-induced ABA prevents the excessive accumulation of H(2)O(2), through the induction of the expression of CATB gene during water stress.
ers079.pdf	The rice ERF transcription factor OsERF922 negatively regulates resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and salt tolerance	2012	J Exp Bot	Key Laboratory of Plant Pathology, Department of Plant Pathology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	Rice OsERF922, encoding an APETELA2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) type transcription factor, is rapidly and strongly induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and salt treatments, as well as by both virulent and avirulent pathovars of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. OsERF922 is localized to the nucleus, binds specifically to the GCC box sequence, and acts as a transcriptional activator in plant cells. Knockdown of OsERF922 by means of RNAi enhanced resistance against M. oryzae. The elevated disease resistance of the RNAi plants was associated with increased expression of PR, PAL, and the other genes encoding phytoalexin biosynthetic enzymes and without M. oryzae infection. In contrast, OsERF922-overexpressing plants showed reduced expression of these defence-related genes and enhanced susceptibility to M. oryzae. In addition, the OsERF922-overexpressing lines exhibited decreased tolerance to salt stress with an increased Na(+)/K(+) ratio in the shoots. The ABA levels were found increased in the overexpressing lines and decreased in the RNAi plants. Expression of the ABA biosynthesis-related genes, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) 3 and 4, was upregulated in the OsERF922-overexpressing plants, and NCED4 was downregulated in the RNAi lines. These results suggest that OsERF922 is integrated into the cross-talk between biotic and abiotic stress-signalling networks perhaps through modulation of the ABA levels.
ers206.pdf	A rice F-box gene, OsFbx352, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice	2012	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing 100093 PR China.	F-box proteins play diverse roles in regulating numerous physiological processes in plants. This study isolated a gene (OsFbx352) from rice encoding an F-box domain protein and characterized its role in seed germination. Expression of OsFbx352 was upregulated by abscisic acid (ABA). The transcripts of OsFbx352 were increased upon imbibition of rice seeds and the increase was markedly suppressed by glucose. Germination of seeds with overexpression of OsFbx352 was less suppressed by glucose than that of wild-type seeds, while glucose had greater inhibition for germination of seeds with knockdown of OsFbx352 by RNA interference (RNAi) than that of wild-type seeds. The differential response of germination of the transgenic and wild-type seeds to glucose may be accounted for by differences in ABA content among overexpressing, RNAi, and wild-type seeds such that overexpression of OsFbx352 and knockdown of OsFbx352 led to lower and higher ABA contents, respectively, than that of wild-type seeds in the presence of glucose. Overexpression of OsFbx352 led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for ABA synthesis (OsNced2, OsNced3) and an increase in expression of genes encoding ABA catabolism (OsAba-ox2, OsAba-ox3) in the presence of glucose. These findings indicate that OsFbx352 plays a regulatory role in the regulation of glucose-induced suppression of seed germination by targeting ABA metabolism.
Oliver-2007-ABA regulates apopla.pdf	ABA regulates apoplastic sugar transport and is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility in rice	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	CSIRO Plant Industry, Canberra, ACT, Australia.	Cold temperatures cause pollen sterility and large reductions in grain yield in temperate rice growing regions of the world. Induction of pollen sterility by cold involves a disruption of sugar transport in anthers, caused by the cold-induced repression of the apoplastic sugar transport pathway in the tapetum. Here we demonstrate that the phytohormone ABA is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility (CIPS). Cold treatment of the cold-sensitive cultivar Doongara resulted in increased anther ABA levels. Exogenous ABA treatment at the young microspore stage induced pollen sterility and affected cell wall invertase and monosaccharide transporter gene expression in a way similar to cold treatment. In the cold-tolerant cultivar R31, ABA levels were significantly lower under normal circumstances and remained low after cold treatment. The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated with differences in expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (OSZEP1) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OSNCED2, OSNCED3) in anthers. The expression of three ABA-8-hydroxylase genes (ABA8OX1, 2 and 3) in R31 anthers was higher under control conditions and was regulated differently by cold compared with Doongara. Our results indicate that the cold tolerance phenotype of R31 is correlated with lower endogenous ABA levels and a different regulation of ABA metabolism.
Plant Cell Physiol-2007-Saika-287-98.pdf	Ethylene promotes submergence-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, a gene that encodes ABA 8'-hydroxylase in rice	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	A rapid decrease of the plant hormone ABA under submergence is thought to be a prerequisite for the enhanced elongation of submerged shoots of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we report that the level of phaseic acid (PA), an oxidized form of ABA, increased with decreasing ABA level during submergence. The oxidation of ABA to PA is catalyzed by ABA 8'-hydroxylase, which is possibly encoded by three genes (OsABA8ox1, -2 and -3) in rice. The ABA 8'-hydroxylase activity was confirmed in microsomes from yeast expressing OsABA8ox1. OsABA8ox1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in onion cells was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA level of OsABA8ox1, but not the mRNA levels of other OsABA8ox genes, increased dramatically within 1 h after submergence. On the other hand, the mRNA levels of genes involved in ABA biosynthesis (OsZEP and OsNCEDs) decreased after 1-2 h of submergence. Treatment of aerobic seedlings with ethylene and its precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), rapidly induced the expression of OsABA8ox1, but the ethylene treatment did not strongly affect the expression of ABA biosynthetic genes. Moreover, pre-treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), a potent inhibitor of ethylene action, partially suppressed induction of OsABA8ox1 expression under submergence. The ABA level was found to be negatively correlated with OsABA8ox1 expression under ACC or 1-MCP treatment. Together, these results indicate that the rapid decrease in ABA levels in submerged rice shoots is controlled partly by ethylene-induced expression of OsABA8ox1 and partly by ethylene-independent suppression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of ABA.
Plant Cell Physiol-2009-Zhu-644-51.pdf	Glucose-induced delay of seed germination in rice is mediated by the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than an enhancement of ABA biosynthesis	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	College of Life Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangdong, PR China.	Both glucose and ABA play crucial roles in the regulation of seed germination and post-germination development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, up-regulation of ABA biosynthesis is suggested as one of the possible mechanisms mediating the glucose-induced delay in seed germination. Since the endogenous ABA level is controlled by the equilibrium between ABA biosynthesis and catabolism, we investigated how this equilibrium is related to the regulation of seed germination by glucose in rice. When ABA biosynthesis was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of the ABA anabolic enzyme 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), rice seed germination showed no response. In contrast, inhibition of ABA catabolism by diniconazole significantly arrested seed germination, suggesting that the regulation of ABA catabolism plays a major role. Further experiments indicated that the expression of OsABA8ox3, a key gene in ABA catabolism and encoding ABA 8'-hydroxylase in rice, was significantly increased during the first 6 h of imbibition, which was consistent with the decline of ABA content in the imbibed seeds. Expression of OsABA8ox genes, especially OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3, was sensitively suppressed in the presence of exogenously supplied glucose. In contrast, the expression profiles of OsNCED genes that control the limiting step of ABA biosynthesis showed no significant changes in response to low levels of glucose. Our results demonstrated that the glucose-induced delay of seed germination is a result of the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than any enhancement of ABA biosynthesis during rice seed germination.
NA	9-cis-Epoxycarotenoid Dioxygenase 3 Regulates Plant Growth and Enhances Multi-Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Rice	2018	Frontiers in plant science	Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Crop Sterile Germplasm Resource Innovation and Application, College of Life Science, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China	Although abscisic acid (ABA) is an important hormone that regulates seed dormancy, stomatal closure, plant development, as well as responses to environmental stimuli, the physiological mechanisms of ABA response to multiple stress in rice remain poorly understood. In the ABA biosynthetic pathway, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) is the key rate-limiting enzyme. Here, we report important functions of OsNCED3 in multi-abiotic stress tolerance in rice. The OsNCED3 is constitutively expressed in various tissues under normal condition, Its expression is highly induced by NaCl, PEG, and H2O2 stress, suggesting the roles for OsNCED3 in response to the multi-abiotic stress tolerance in rice. Compared with wild-type plants, nced3 mutants had earlier seed germination, longer post-germination seedling growth, increased sensitivity to water stress and H2O2 stress and increased stomata aperture under water stress and delayed leaf senescence. Further analysis found that nced3 mutants contained lower ABA content compared with wild-type plants, overexpression of OsNCED3 in transgenic plants could enhance water stress tolerance, promote leaf senescence and increase ABA content. We conclude that OsNCED3 mediates seed dormancy, plant growth, abiotic stress tolerance, and leaf senescence by regulating ABA biosynthesis in rice; and may provide a new strategy for improving the quality of crop.
