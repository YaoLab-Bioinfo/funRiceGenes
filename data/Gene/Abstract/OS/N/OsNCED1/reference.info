We previously reported that a rare sugar D-allose, which is the D-glucose epimer at C3, inhibits the gibberellin-dependent responses such as elongation of the second leaf sheath and induction of alpha-amylase in embryo-less half seeds in rice (Fukumoto et al. 2011). D-Allose suppresses expressions of gibberellin-responsive genes downstream of SLR1 protein in the gibberellin-signaling through hexokinase (HXK)-dependent pathway. In this study, we discovered that D-allose induced expression of ABA-related genes including OsNCED1-3 and OsABA8ox1-3 in rice. Interestingly, D-allose also up-regulated expression of OsABF1, encoding a conserved bZIP transcription factor in ABA signaling, in rice. The D-allose-induced expression of OsABF1 was diminished by a hexokinase inhibitor, D-mannoheptulose (MNH). Consistently, D-allose also inhibited Arabidopsis growth, but failed to trigger growth retardation in the glucose-insensitive2 (gin2) mutant, which is a loss-of-function mutant of the glucose sensor AtHXK1. D-Allose activated AtABI5 expression in transgenic gin2 over-expressing wild-type AtHXK1 but not in gin2 over-expressing the catalytic mutant AtHXK1(S177A), indicating that the D-allose phosphorylation by HXK to D-allose 6-phosphate (A6P) is the first step for the up-regulation of AtABI5 gene expression as well as D-allose-induced growth inhibition. Moreover, overexpression of OsABF1 showed increased sensitivity to D-allose in rice. These findings indicated that the phosphorylation of D-allose at C6 by hexokinase is essential and OsABF1 is involved in the signal transduction for D-allose-induced growth inhibition.
pgen.1001098.pdf	The APETALA-2-Like Transcription Factor OsAP2-39 Controls Key Interactions between Abscisic Acid and Gibberellin in Rice	2010	PLoS Genet	Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada	The interaction between phytohormones is an important mechanism which controls growth and developmental processes in plants. Deciphering these interactions is a crucial step in helping to develop crops with enhanced yield and resistance to environmental stresses. Controlling the expression level of OsAP2-39 which includes an APETALA 2 (AP2) domain leads to phenotypic changes in rice. Overexpression of OsAP2-39 leads to a reduction in yield by decreasing the biomass and the number of seeds in the transgenic rice lines. Global transcriptome analysis of the OsAP2-39 overexpression transgenic rice revealed the upregulation of a key Abscisic Acid (ABA) biosynthetic gene OsNCED-I which codes for 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase and leads to an increase in the endogenous ABA level. In addition to OsNCED-1, the gene expression analysis revealed the upregulation of a gene that codes for the Elongation of Upper most Internode (EUI) protein, an enzyme that catalyzes 16a, 17-epoxidation of non-13-hydroxylated GAs, which has been shown to deactivate gibberellins (GAs) in rice. The exogenous application of GA restores the wild-type phenotype in the transgenic line and ABA application induces the expression of EUI and suppresses the expression of OsAP2-39 in the wild-type line. These observations clarify the antagonistic relationship between ABA and GA and illustrate a mechanism that leads to homeostasis of these hormones. In vivo and in vitro analysis showed that the expression of both OsNCED-1 and EUI are directly controlled by OsAP2-39. Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism for the control of the ABA/GA balance in rice which is regulated by OsAP2-39 that in turn regulates plant growth and seed production.
Plant Cell Physiol-2007-Saika-287-98.pdf	Ethylene promotes submergence-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, a gene that encodes ABA 8'-hydroxylase in rice	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	A rapid decrease of the plant hormone ABA under submergence is thought to be a prerequisite for the enhanced elongation of submerged shoots of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we report that the level of phaseic acid (PA), an oxidized form of ABA, increased with decreasing ABA level during submergence. The oxidation of ABA to PA is catalyzed by ABA 8'-hydroxylase, which is possibly encoded by three genes (OsABA8ox1, -2 and -3) in rice. The ABA 8'-hydroxylase activity was confirmed in microsomes from yeast expressing OsABA8ox1. OsABA8ox1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in onion cells was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA level of OsABA8ox1, but not the mRNA levels of other OsABA8ox genes, increased dramatically within 1 h after submergence. On the other hand, the mRNA levels of genes involved in ABA biosynthesis (OsZEP and OsNCEDs) decreased after 1-2 h of submergence. Treatment of aerobic seedlings with ethylene and its precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), rapidly induced the expression of OsABA8ox1, but the ethylene treatment did not strongly affect the expression of ABA biosynthetic genes. Moreover, pre-treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), a potent inhibitor of ethylene action, partially suppressed induction of OsABA8ox1 expression under submergence. The ABA level was found to be negatively correlated with OsABA8ox1 expression under ACC or 1-MCP treatment. Together, these results indicate that the rapid decrease in ABA levels in submerged rice shoots is controlled partly by ethylene-induced expression of OsABA8ox1 and partly by ethylene-independent suppression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of ABA.
Plant Cell Physiol-2009-Zhu-644-51.pdf	Glucose-induced delay of seed germination in rice is mediated by the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than an enhancement of ABA biosynthesis	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	College of Life Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangdong, PR China.	Both glucose and ABA play crucial roles in the regulation of seed germination and post-germination development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, up-regulation of ABA biosynthesis is suggested as one of the possible mechanisms mediating the glucose-induced delay in seed germination. Since the endogenous ABA level is controlled by the equilibrium between ABA biosynthesis and catabolism, we investigated how this equilibrium is related to the regulation of seed germination by glucose in rice. When ABA biosynthesis was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of the ABA anabolic enzyme 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), rice seed germination showed no response. In contrast, inhibition of ABA catabolism by diniconazole significantly arrested seed germination, suggesting that the regulation of ABA catabolism plays a major role. Further experiments indicated that the expression of OsABA8ox3, a key gene in ABA catabolism and encoding ABA 8'-hydroxylase in rice, was significantly increased during the first 6 h of imbibition, which was consistent with the decline of ABA content in the imbibed seeds. Expression of OsABA8ox genes, especially OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3, was sensitively suppressed in the presence of exogenously supplied glucose. In contrast, the expression profiles of OsNCED genes that control the limiting step of ABA biosynthesis showed no significant changes in response to low levels of glucose. Our results demonstrated that the glucose-induced delay of seed germination is a result of the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than any enhancement of ABA biosynthesis during rice seed germination.
NA	RNAi-mediated Suppression of Three Rice Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase Genes, OsCCD1, 4a, and 4b, Increases Carotenoid Content of Rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	Department of Genetic Engineering and Graduate School of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Republic of Korea.	Carotenoids of staple food crops have high nutritional value as provitamin A components in the daily diet. To increase the levels of carotenoids, inhibition of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs), which degrade carotenoids, has been considered as a promising target in crop biotechnology. Suppression of the OsCCD1, OsCCD4a, and OsCCD4b genes using RNA interference (Ri) was verified in transgenic rice plants by quantitative RT-PCR and small RNA detection. Leaf carotenoids were statistically increased overall in OsCCD4a_Ri lines of the T1 generation, and the highest accumulation of 1.3-fold was found in the OsCCD4a_Ri 7 line of the T2 generation relative to non-transgenic plants. The effects on seed carotenoids were elucidated via cross-fertilization between ¦Â-carotene-producing transgenic rice and one of two independent homozygous lines of OsCCD1_Ri, OsCCD4a_Ri or OsCCD4b_Ri. As a result, seed carotenoids were increased to a maximum of 1.4- and 1.6-fold in OsCCD1_Ri and OsCCD4a_Ri, respectively, with a different preference toward ¦Á-ring carotenoids and -ring carotenoids; levels were not established in OsCCD4b_Ri. In addition, the levels of four carotenoids decreased when OsCCD1, OsCCD4a, and OsCCD4b were overexpressed in E. coli strains accumulating phytoene, lycopene, -carotene, and zeaxanthin. OsCCD1 and OsCCD4a had a similar high carotenoid degrading activity, followed by OsCCD4b without substrate specificity. Collectively, the blocking of OsCCD4a activity might have potential as a practical tool for enhancing the carotenoid level of the carotenoid-accumulating seed endosperms as well as leaves of rice plants.
NA	Developmental analysis of the early steps in strigolactone-mediated axillary bud dormancy in rice.	2019	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	In contrast to the rapid progress in understanding the mechanisms of the biosynthesis and signaling of strigolactone (SL), the mechanisms by which SL inhibits the outgrowth of axillary buds are less well understood. We established a rice (Oryza sativa L.) hydroponic culture system to observe axillary buds at the critical point when the buds enter the dormant state. In situ hybridization analysis indicates that cell division stops in the leaf primordia of the buds entering dormancy. We compared transcriptomes in the axillary buds isolated by laser capture microdissection before and after entering the dormant state and identified genes that are specifically up- or down-regulated in dormant buds respectively, in SL-mediated axillary bud dormancy. Typically, cell cycle genes and ribosomal genes are included among the active genes while Abscisic acid (ABA)-inducible genes are among the dormant genes. Application of ABA to the hydroponic culture suppressed the growth of axillary buds of SL mutants to the same level as WT buds. Tiller number was decreased in the transgenic lines overexpressing OsNCED1, the gene that encodes the ABA biosynthesis enzyme. These results indicate that the main site of SL function is the leaf primordia in the axillary bud and that ABA is involved in SL-mediated axillary bud dormancy.

NA	¦Æ-Carotene Isomerase Suppresses Tillering in Rice through the Coordinated Biosynthesis of Strigolactone and Abscisic Acid	2020	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Rice tillering is an important agronomic trait affecting grain yield. Here, we identified a high-tillering mutant tillering20 (t20), which could be restored to the wild type by treatment with the strigolactone (SL) analog rac-GR24. T20 encodes a chloroplast ¦Æ-carotene isomerase (Z-ISO), which is involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids and their metabolites, SL and abscisic acid (ABA). The t20 mutant has reduced SL and ABA, raising the question of how SL and ABA biosynthesis is coordinated, and whether they have overlapping functions in tillering. We discovered that rac-GR24 stimulated T20 expression and enhanced all-trans-¦Â-carotene biosynthesis. Importantly, rac-GR24 also stimulated expression of Oryza sativa 9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 1 (OsNCED1) through induction of Oryza sativa HOMEOBOX12 (OsHOX12), promoting ABA biosynthesis in shoot base. On the other hand, ABA treatment significantly repressed SL biosynthesis and the ABA biosynthetic mutants displayed elevated SL biosynthesis. ABA treatment reduced the number of basal tillers in both t20 and wild-type plants. Furthermore, while ABA-deficient mutants aba1 and aba2 had the same number of basal tillers as wild type, they had more unproductive upper tillers at maturity. This work demonstrates complex interactions in the biosynthesis of carotenoid, SLs and ABA, and reveals a role for ABA in the regulation of rice tillering.
