OsNRAMP5	 The expression level of some transporter genes including OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 for Si uptake and OsNramp5 for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice
OsNRAMP5	Effects of external Mn2+ activities on OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in indica rice. |  However, the relationship between OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation, impacts of external ion activities on OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation are still unclear |  Investigations of the relationship between OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in three indica rice genotypes were conducted under various external Mn2+ activities ranging from Mn deficiency to toxicity in EGTA-buffered nutrient solution |  Results in this work indicated that OsNRAMP5 expression level in roots significantly up-regulated at Mn phytotoxicity compared to that at Mn deficiency, which may stimulate by the increasing uptake of Mn |  Our work also revealed that the relationship between OsNRAMP5 expression level in roots and Cd accumulation in roots was insignificant for all the tested genotypes |  Besides, OsNRAMP5 expression level in roots seemed more related to root Mn accumulation |  The fact that function of OsNRAMP5 mainly focuses on Mn uptake, together with the fact that many transporter genes involved in Cd uptake might result in the insignificant correlation between OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in roots |  At last, multi-level regulating and processing of the process from gene expression to protein translation might account for the inconsistent relationship between root OsNRAMP5 expression level and Cd accumulation in roots
OsNRAMP5	 Meanwhile, application of sufficient doses of Fe and Cd in solution culture increased RE of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 in roots, whereas expression level of OsHMA3 was decreased |  Similarly, expression level of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, and OsNRAMP1 significantly increased in roots in high Cd and Mn deficient treatments |  This may be concluded that the Cd increases expression of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 but decreases OsHMA3 expression in rice roots, which resulted in increased Cd uptake in hydroponically grown rice
