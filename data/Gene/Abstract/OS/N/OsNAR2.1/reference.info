Feng-2011-Spatial expression a.pdf	Spatial expression and regulation of rice high-affinity nitrate transporters by nitrogen and carbon status	2011	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, PR China. ghxu@njau.edu.cn	The high affinity nitrate transport system (HATS) plays an important role in rice nitrogen acquisition because, even under flooded anaerobic cultivation when NH(4)(+) dominates, significant nitrification occurs on the root surface. In the rice genome, four NRT2 and two NAR2 genes encoding HATS components have been identified. One gene OsNRT2.3 was mRNA spliced into OsNRT2.3a and OsNRT2.3b and OsNAR2.1 interacts with OsNRT2.1/2.2 and OsNRT2.3a to provide nitrate uptake. Using promoter-GUS reporter plants and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses, it was observed that OsNAR2.1 was expressed mainly in the root epidermal cells, differently from the five OsNRT2 genes. OsNAR2.1, OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2, and OsNRT2.3a were up-regulated by nitrate and suppressed by NH(4)(+) and high root temperature (37 degrees C). Expression of all these genes was increased by light or external sugar supply. Root transcripts of OsNRT2.3b and OsNRT2.4 were much less abundant and not affected by temperature. Expression of OsNRT2.3b was insensitive to the form of N supply. Expression of OsNRT2.4 responded to changes in auxin supply unlike all the other NRT2 genes. A region from position -311 to -1, relative to the translation start site in the promoter region of OsNAR2.1, was found to contain the cis-element(s) necessary for the nitrate-, but not light- and sugar-dependent activation. However, it was difficult to define a conserved cis-element in the promoters of the nitrate-regulated OsNRT2/OsNAR2 genes. The results imply distinct physiological functions for each OsNRT2 transporter, and differential regulation pathways by N and C status.
j.1365-3040.2011.02335.x.pdf	Rice OsNAR2.1 interacts with OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2 and OsNRT2.3a nitrate transporters to provide uptake over high and low concentration ranges	2011	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Plants take up both nitrate and ammonium as main nitrogen (N) sources. Although ammonium is the predominant form in anaerobic-flooded paddy soil, it has been proposed that rice and other wetland plants may take up significant amounts of nitrate formed by nitrification of ammonium in the rhizosphere. A two-component system for nitrate transport including NRT2s with a partner protein (NAR2 or NRT3.1) has been identified in Arabidopsis. We report the physiological function of another member of the NAR2 family, OsNAR2.1 in rice (Oryza sativa, ssp. Japonica, cv. Nipponbare). OsNAR2.1 was mainly expressed in roots and induced by nitrate and suppressed by ammonium and some amino acids. Knockdown of OsNAR2.1 by RNA interference synchronously suppressed expression of OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2 and OsNRT2.3a in the osnar2.1mutants. Both high- and low-affinity nitrate transports were greatly impaired by OsNAR2.1 knockdown. Yeast two hybridization showed that OsNAR2.1 not only interacted with OsNRT2.1/OsNRT2.2, but also with OsNRT2.3a. Taken together, the data demonstrate that OsNAR2.1 plays a key role in enabling the plant to cope with variable nitrate supply.
NA	Identification and functional assay of the interaction motifs in the partner protein OsNAR2.1 of the two-component system for high-affinity nitrate transport.	2014	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	A partner protein, NAR2, is essential for high-affinity nitrate transport of the NRT2 protein in plants. However, the NAR2 motifs that interact with NRT2s for their plasma membrane (PM) localization and nitrate transporter activity have not been functionally characterized. In this study, OsNAR2.1 mutations with different carbon (C)-terminal deletions and nine different point mutations in the conserved regions of NAR2 homologs in plants were generated to explore the essential motifs involved in the interaction with OsNRT2.3a. Screening using the membrane yeast two-hybrid system and Xenopus oocytes for nitrogen-15 ((15)N) uptake demonstrated that either R100G or D109N point mutations impaired the OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNRT2.3a. Western blotting and visualization using green fluorescent protein fused to either the N- or C-terminus of OsNAR2.1 indicated that OsNAR2.1 is expressed in both the PM and cytoplasm. The split-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)/BiFC analyses indicated that OsNRT2.3a was targeted to the PM in the presence of OsNAR2.1, while either R100G or D109N mutation resulted in the loss of OsNRT2.3a-YFP signal in the PM. Based on these results, arginine 100 and aspartic acid 109 of the OsNAR2.1 protein are key amino acids in the interaction with OsNRT2.3a, and their interaction occurs in the PM but not cytoplasm.
NA	Two short sequences in OsNAR2.1 promoter are necessary for fully activating the nitrate induced gene expression in rice roots.	2015	Sci Rep	1] State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement [2] MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Lower-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Nitrate is an essential nitrogen source and serves as a signal to control growth and gene expression in plants. In rice, OsNAR2.1 is an essential partner of multiple OsNRT2 nitrate transporters for nitrate uptake over low and high concentration range. Previously, we have reported that -311 bp upstream fragment from the translational start site in the promoter of OsNAR2.1 gene is the nitrate responsive region. To identify the cis-acting DNA elements necessary for nitrate induced gene expression, we detected the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter in the transgenic rice driven by the OsNAR2.1 promoter with different lengths and site mutations of the 311 bp region. We found that -129 to -1 bp region is necessary for the nitrate-induced full activation of OsNAR2.1. Besides, the site mutations showed that the 20 bp fragment between -191 and -172 bp contains an enhancer binding site necessary to fully drive the OsNAR2.1 expression. Part of the 20 bp fragment is commonly presented in the sequences of different promoters of both the nitrate induced NAR2 genes and nitrite reductase NIR1 genes from various higher plants. These findings thus reveal the presence of conserved cis-acting element for mediating nitrate responses in plants.
NA	Knockdown of the partner protein OsNAR2.1 for high-affinity nitrate transport represses lateral root formation in a nitrate-dependent manner.	2015	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, P.R. China.	The morphological plasticity of root systems is critical for plant survival, and understanding the mechanisms underlying root adaptation to nitrogen (N) fluctuation is critical for sustainable agriculture; however, the molecular mechanism of N-dependent root growth in rice remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the role of the complementary high-affinity NO3(-) transport protein OsNAR2.1 in NO3(-)-regulated rice root growth. Comparisons with wild-type (WT) plants showed that knockdown of OsNAR2.1 inhibited lateral root (LR) formation under low NO3(-) concentrations, but not under low NH4(+) concentrations. (15)N-labelling NO3(-) supplies (provided at concentrations of 0-10 mM) demonstrated that (i) defects in LR formation in mutants subjected to low external NO3(-) concentrations resulted from impaired NO3(-) uptake, and (ii) the mutants had significantly fewer LRs than the WT plants when root N contents were similar between genotypes. LR formation in osnar2.1 mutants was less sensitive to localised NO3(-) supply than LR formation in WT plants, suggesting that OsNAR2.1 may be involved in a NO3(-)-signalling pathway that controls LR formation. Knockdown of OsNAR2.1 inhibited LR formation by decreasing auxin transport from shoots to roots. Thus, OsNAR2.1 probably functions in both NO3(-) uptake and NO3(-)-signalling.
NA	pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 expression enhances nitrogen uptake efficiency and grain yield in transgenic rice plants.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	The nitrate (NO3(-) ) transporter has been selected as an important gene maker in the process of environmental adoption in rice cultivars. In this work, we transfered another native OsNAR2.1 promoter with driving OsNAR2.1 gene into rice plants. The transgenic lines with exogenous pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 constructs showed enhanced OsNAR2.1 expression level, compared with wild type (WT), and (15) N influx in roots increased 21-32% in response to 0.2 mM and 2.5 mM (15) NO3(-) and 1.25 mM (15) NH4(15) NO3 . Under these three N conditions, the biomass of the pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 transgenic lines increased 143, 129, and 51%, and total N content increased 161, 242, and 69%, respectively, compared to WT. Furthermore in field experiments we fould the grain yield, agricultural nitrogen use efficiency (ANUE), and dry matter transfer of pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 plants increased by about 21, 22, and 21%, compared to WT. We also compared the phenotypes of pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 and pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 transgenic lines in the field, found that post-anthesis N uptake differed significantly between them, and in comparison with the WT. Post-anthesis N uptake (PANU) increased approximately 39% and 85%, in the pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 and pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 transgenic lines, respectively, possibly because OsNRT2.1 expression was less in the pOsNAR2.1:OsNAR2.1 lines than in the pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 lines during the late growth stage. These results show that rice NO3(-) uptake, yield, and NUE were improved by increased OsNAR2.1 expression via its native promoter. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	OsNAR2.1 Positively Regulates Drought Tolerance and Grain Yield Under Drought Stress Conditions in Rice.	2019	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Drought is an important environmental factor that severely restricts crop production. The high-affinity nitrate transporter partner protein OsNAR2.1 plays an essential role in nitrate absorption and translocation in rice. Our results suggest that OsNAR2.1 expression is markedly induced by water deficit. After drought stress conditions and irrigation, compared with wild-type (WT), the survival rate was significantly improved in OsNAR2.1 over-expression lines and decreased in OsNAR2.1 RNAi lines. The survival rate of Wuyunjing7 (WYJ), OsNRT2.1 over-expression lines and OsNRT2.3a over-expression lines was not significantly different. Compared with WT, overexpression of OsNAR2.1 could significantly increase nitrogen uptake in rice, and OsNAR2.1 RNAi could significantly reduce nitrogen uptake. Under drought conditions, the expression of OsNAC10, OsSNAC1, OsDREB2a, and OsAP37 was significantly reduced in OsNAR2.1 RNAi lines and increased substantially in OsNAR2.1 over-expression lines. Also, the chlorophyll content, relative water content, photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency were decreased considerably in OsNAR2.1 RNAi lines and increased significantly in OsNAR2.1 over-expression lines under drought conditions. Finally, compared to WT, grain yield increased by about 9.1 and 26.6%, in OsNAR2.1 over-expression lines under full and limited irrigation conditions, respectively. These results indicate that OsNAR2.1 regulates the response to drought stress in rice and increases drought tolerance.
NA	OsNAR2.1 interaction with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 functions in root-growth responses to nitrate and ammonium.	2020	Plant Physiol	Nanjing Agricultural University CITY: Nanjing China [CN].	The nitrate transport accessory protein OsNAR2 plays a critical role in root-growth responses to nitrate and nitrate acquisition in rice (Oryza sativa). In this study, a pull-down assay combined with yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that OsNAR2.1 interacts with OsNIT1 and OsNIT2. Moreover, an in vitro nitrilase activity assay indicated that indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) is hydrolyzed to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) by OsNIT1, the activity of which was enhanced 3-4-fold by OsNIT2 and in excess of 5-8-fold by OsNAR2.1. Knockout (KO) of OsNAR2.1 was accompanied by repressed expression of both OsNIT1 and OsNIT2, whereas KO of OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 in the osnit1 and osnit2 mutant lines did not affect expression of OsNAR2.1 or the root nitrate acquisition rate. osnit1 and osnit2 displayed decreased primary root length and lateral root density. Double KO of OsNAR2.1 and OsNIT2 caused further decreases in lateral root density under nitrate supply . Ammonium supply repressed OsNAR2.1 expression whereas it upregulated OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 expression. Both osnit1 and osnit2 showed root growth hypersensitivity to external ammonium; however, less root growth sensitivity to external IAN, higher expression of three IAA-amido synthetase (GH3) genes, and a lower rate of 3H-IAA movement towards the roots were observed. Taken together, we conclude that the interaction of OsNIT1 and OsNIT2 activated by OsNAR2.1 and nitrogen supply is essential for maintaining root growth possibly via altering the IAA ratio of free to conjugate forms and facilitating its transportation.
NA	Co-Overexpression of OsNAR2.1 and OsNRT2.3a Increased Agronomic Nitrogen Use Efficiency in Transgenic Rice Plants	2020	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	The NO3 - transporter plays an important role in rice nitrogen acquisition and nitrogen-use efficiency. Our previous studies have shown that the high affinity systems for nitrate uptake in rice is mediated by a two-component NRT2/NAR2 transport system. In this study, transgenic plants were successful developed by overexpression of OsNAR2.1 alone, OsNRT2.3a alone and co-overexpression of OsNAR2.1 and OsNRT2.3a. Our field experiments indicated that transgenic lines expressing p35S:OsNAR2.1 or p35S:OsNAR2.1-p35S:OsNRT2.3a constructs exhibited increased grain yields of approximately 14.1% and 24.6% compared with wild-type (cv. Wuyunjing 7, WT) plants, and the agricultural nitrogen use efficiency increased by 15.8% and 28.6%, respectively. Compared with WT, the 15N influx in roots of p35S:OsNAR2.1 and p35S: OsNAR2.1-p35S:OsNRT2.3a lines increased 18.9%<U+2011>27.8% in response to 0.2 mM, 2.5 mM 15NO3 -, and 1.25 mM 15NH4 15NO3, while there was no significant difference between p35S:OsNAR2.1 and p35S:OsNAR2.1-p35S:OsNRT2.3a lines; only the 15N distribution ratio of shoot to root for p35S:OsNAR2.1-p35S:OsNRT2.3a lines increased significantly. However, there were no significant differences in nitrogen use efficiency, 15N influx in roots and the yield between the p35S:NRT2.3a transgenic lines and WT. This study indicated that co-overexpression of OsNAR2.1 and OsNRT2.3a could increase rice yield and nitrogen use efficiency.
NA	Modulation of nitrate-induced phosphate response by the MYB transcription factor RLI1/HINGE1 in the nucleus	2020	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, the Innovative Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.	The coordinated utilization of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) is vital for plants to maintain nutrient balance and achieve optimal growth. Previously, we revealed a mechanism by which nitrate induces genes for phosphate utilization; this mechanism depends on NRT1.1B-facilitated degradation of cytoplasmic SPX4, which in turn promotes cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of PHR2, the central transcription factor of phosphate signaling, and triggers the nitrate-induced phosphate response (NIPR) and N-P coordinated utilization in rice. In this study, we unveiled a fine-tuning mechanism of NIPR in the nucleus regulated by Highly Induced by Nitrate Gene 1 (HINGE1, also known as RLI1), a MYB-transcription factor closely related to PHR2. RLI1/HINGE1, which is transcriptionally activated by PHR2 under nitrate induction, can directly activate the expression of phosphate starvation-induced genes. More importantly, RLI1/HINGE1 competes with PHR2 for binding to its repressor proteins in the nucleus (SPX proteins), and consequently releases PHR2 to further enhance phosphate response. Therefore, RLI1/HINGE1 amplifies the phosphate response in the nucleus downstream of the cytoplasmic SPX4-PHR2 cascade, thereby enabling fine-tuning of N-P balance when nitrate supply is sufficient.
