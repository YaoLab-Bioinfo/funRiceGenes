OsLEA3|OsLEA3-1	OsNAC5	The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC5 regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice	By microarray analysis, many stress-inducible genes, including the "late embryogenesis abundant" gene OsLEA3, were upregulated in rice plants that overexpressed OsNAC5
OsLEA3|OsLEA3-1	OsNAC5	The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC5 regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice	By gel mobility shift assay, OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 were shown to bind to the OsLEA3 promoter
OsLEA3|OsLEA3-1	OsNAC5	The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC5 regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice	Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different
OsNAC19|SNAC1|OsNAC9	OsNAC5	The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC5 regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice	Pull-down assays revealed that OsNAC5 interacts with OsNAC5, OsNAC6 and SNAC1
OsNAC5	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC5 regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice	Pull-down assays revealed that OsNAC5 interacts with OsNAC5, OsNAC6 and SNAC1
OsNAC5	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC5 regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice	By gel mobility shift assay, OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 were shown to bind to the OsLEA3 promoter
OsNAC5	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC5 regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice	Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different
OsNAC5	OsNAS3	Identification of up-regulated genes in flag leaves during rice grain filling and characterization of OsNAC5, a new ABA-dependent transcription factor	Differential expression of selected genes (encoding 7 transport proteins, the OsNAS3 enzyme and the OsNAC5 transcription factor) was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR
ONAC106	OsNAC5	Rice ONAC106 inhibits leaf senescence and increases salt tolerance and tiller angle.	Using yeast one-hybrid assays, we found that ONAC106 binds to the promoter regions of SGR, NYC1, OsNAC5, and LPA1
OsCCR10	OsNAC5	Transcriptional activation of rice CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE 10 by OsNAC5, contributes to drought tolerance by modulating lignin accumulation in roots.	 Here, we report that the rice (Oryza sativa) gene CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE 10 (OsCCR10) is directly activated by the OsNAC5 transcription factor, which mediates drought tolerance through regulating lignin accumulation
