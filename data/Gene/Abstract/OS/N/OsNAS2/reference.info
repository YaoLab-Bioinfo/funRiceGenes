2011-26.pdf	Ethylene is involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron-acquisition-related genes in Oryza sativa	2011	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.	Plants employ two distinct strategies to obtain iron (Fe) from the soil. In Strategy I but not Strategy II plants, Fe limitation invokes ethylene production which regulates Fe deficiency responses. Oryza sativa (rice) is the only graminaceous plant described that possesses a Strategy I-like system for iron uptake as well as the classic Strategy II system. Ethylene production of rice roots was significantly increased when grown under Fe-depleted conditions. Moreover, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) treatment, a precursor of ethylene, conferred tolerance to Fe deficiency in rice by increasing internal Fe availability. Gene expression analysis of rice iron-regulated bHLH transcription factor OsIRO2, nicotianamine synthases 1 and 2 (NAS1 and NAS2), yellow-stripe like transporter 15 (YSL15) and iron-regulated transporter (IRT1) indicated that ethylene caused an increase in transcript abundance of both Fe (II) and Fe (III)-phytosiderophore uptake systems. RNA interference of OsIRO2 in transgenic rice showed that ethylene acted via this transcription factor to induce the expression of OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL15, and OsIRT1. By contrast, in Hordeum vulgare L. (barley), no ethylene production or ethylene-mediated effects of Fe response could be detected. In conclusion, Fe-limiting conditions increased ethylene production and signalling in rice, which is novel in Strategy II plant species.
J. Exp. Bot.-2013-Yang-5009-20.pdf	A receptor-like protein RMC is involved in regulation of iron acquisition in rice	2013	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, PR China.	Iron (Fe) is one of the essential mineral elements for plant growth and development. Acquisition of Fe by plants is mediated by a complex network involving Fe mobilization, uptake by root cells, and transport within plants. Here, we evaluated the role of a previously clarified gene encoding a receptor-like protein from rice, OsRMC, in the regulation of Fe acquisition by comparing Fe concentration, biomass, and expression patterns of genes associated with Fe mobilization and transport in wild-type (WT) rice with those in OsRMC overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown transgenic rice plants. Expression of OsRMC was upregulated in both shoots and roots upon exposure of WT to Fe-deficient medium. Expression levels of OsRMC were positively correlated with Fe concentration in rice plants under both Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient conditions such that overexpression and RNAi lines had higher and lower Fe concentration in both roots and shoots than WT plants, respectively. Moreover, overexpression of OsRMC conferred greater accumulation of Fe in mature seeds under Fe-sufficient conditions. OsRMC may also play a role in regulation of Fe deficiency-induced changes in root growth, as evidenced by greater and smaller root systems of OsRMC overexpression lines and RNAi lines than WT under Fe-deficient conditions, respectively. Several Fe deficiency-responsive genes including OsDMAS1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAAT1, OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsIRO2 were up- and downregulated in OsRMC-overexpressing and RNAi plants compared with WT rice plants. These novel findings highlight an important role of OsRMC played in mediation of Fe acquisition and root growth in rice, particularly under Fe-deficient conditions.
j.1365-313X.2003.01878.x.pdf	Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron	2003	The Plant Journal	Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Nicotianamine (NA), a chelator of metals, is ubiquitously present in higher plants. In graminaceous plants, NA is a biosynthetic precursor of phytosiderophores and is thus a crucial component for iron (Fe) acquisition. Here, we show that three rice NA synthase (NAS) genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of Fe and that the three genes are differentially regulated by Fe. OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 transcripts were detected in Fe-sufficient roots but not in leaves, and levels of both increased markedly in both roots and leaves in response to Fe deficiency. In contrast, the OsNAS3 transcript was present in leaves but was very low in roots of Fe-sufficient plants. Further, OsNAS3 expression was induced in roots but was suppressed in leaves in response to Fe deficiency. Promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 were expressed in Fe-sufficient roots in companion cells and pericycle cells adjacent to the protoxylem. With Fe deficiency, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 expression extended to all root cells along with an increase in phytosiderophore secretion. In Fe-deficient plants, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 were expressed in the vascular bundles of green leaves and in all cells of leaves showing severe chlorosis. OsNAS3 expression was restricted to the pericycle and companion cells of the roots, and in companion cells of leaves irrespective of Fe status. These results strongly suggested that NAS and NA play an important role in long-distance transport of Fe in rice plants, in addition to their roles in phytosiderophore secretion from roots.
j.1365-313X.2009.04015.x.pdf	The rice transcription factor IDEF1 is essential for the early response to iron deficiency, and induces vegetative expression of late embryogenesis abundant genes	2009	Plant J	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Higher plants maintain iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron (Fe)-related genes in accordance with Fe availability. The transcription factor IDEF1 regulates the response to Fe deficiency in Oryza sativa (rice) by recognizing CATGC sequences within the Fe deficiency-responsive cis-acting element IDE1. To investigate the function of IDEF1 in detail, we analyzed the response to Fe deficiency in transgenic rice plants exhibiting induced or repressed IDEF1 expression. Fe-deficiency treatment in hydroponic culture revealed that IDEF1 knock-down plants are susceptible to early-stage Fe deficiency, in contrast to IDEF1-induced plants. Time-course expression analyses using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR revealed that the IDEF1 expression level was positively correlated with the level of induction of the Fe utilization-related genes OsIRO2, OsYSL15, OsIRT1, OsYSL2, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAS3 and OsDMAS1, just after the onset of Fe starvation. However, this overall transactivation mediated by IDEF1 became less evident in subsequent stages. Microarray and in-silico analyses revealed that genes positively regulated by IDEF1, especially at the early stage, exhibit over-representation of CATGC and IDE1-like elements within the proximal promoter regions. These results indicate the existence of early and subsequent responses to Fe deficiency, with the former requiring IDEF1 more specifically. Proximal regions of IDEF1-regulated gene promoters also showed enrichment of RY elements (CATGCA), which regulate gene expression during seed maturation. The expression of several genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant proteins, including Osem, was induced in Fe-deficient roots and/or leaves in an IDEF1-dependent manner, suggesting a possible function of seed maturation-related genes in Fe-deficient vegetative organs.
j.1467-7652.2011.00606.x.pdf	Bio-available zinc in rice seeds is increased by activation tagging of nicotianamine synthase	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	Department of Plant Molecular Systems Biotechnology and Crop Biotech Center, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Republic of Korea.	We generated rice lines with increased content of nicotianamine (NA), a key ligand for metal transport and homeostasis. This was accomplished by activation tagging of rice nicotianamine synthase 2 (OsNAS2). Enhanced expression of the gene resulted in elevated NA levels, greater Zn accumulations and improved plant tolerance to a Zn deficiency. Expression of Zn-uptake genes and those for the biosynthesis of phytosiderophores (PS) were increased in transgenic plants. This suggests that the higher amount of NA led to greater exudation of PS from the roots, as well as stimulated Zn uptake, translocation and seed-loading. In the endosperm, the OsNAS2 activation-tagged line contained up to 20-fold more NA and 2.7-fold more zinc. Liquid chromatography combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed that the total content of zinc complexed with NA and 2'-deoxymugineic acid was increased 16-fold. Mice fed with OsNAS2-D1 seeds recovered more rapidly from a zinc deficiency than did control mice receiving WT seeds. These results demonstrate that the level of bio-available zinc in rice grains can be enhanced significantly by activation tagging of OsNAS2.

Because micronutrients in human diets ultimately come from plant sources, malnutrition of essential minerals is a significant public health concern. By increasing the expression of nicotianamine synthase (NAS), we fortified the level of bioavailable iron in rice seeds. Activation of iron deficiency-inducible OsNAS2 resulted in a rise in Fe content (3.0-fold) in mature seeds. Its ectopic expression also increased that content. Enhanced expression led to higher tolerance of Fe deficiency and better growth under elevated pH. Mice fed with OsNAS2-D1 seeds recovered more rapidly from anemia, indicating that bioavailable Fe contents were improved by this increase in OsNAS2 expression.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs11103-011-9752-6.pdf	OsIRO2 is responsible for iron utilization in rice and improves growth and yield in calcareous soil	2011	Plant Mol Biol	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	Iron (Fe) deficiency, a worldwide agricultural problem on calcareous soil with low Fe availability, is also a major human nutritional deficit. Plants induce Fe acquisition systems under conditions of low Fe availability. Previously, we reported that an Fe-deficiency-inducible basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, OsIRO2, is responsible for regulation of the genes involved in Fe homeostasis in rice. Using promoter-GUS transformants, we showed that OsIRO2 is expressed throughout a plant's lifetime in a spatially and temporally similar manner to the genes OsNAS1, OsNAS2 and TOM1, which is involved in Fe absorption and translocation. During germination, OsIRO2 expression was detected in embryos. OsIRO2 expression in vegetative tissues was restricted almost exclusively to vascular bundles of roots and leaves, and to the root exodermis under Fe-sufficient conditions, and expanded to all tissues of roots and leaves in response to Fe deficiency. OsIRO2 expression was also detected in flowers and developing seeds. Plants overexpressing OsIRO2 grew better, and OsIRO2-repressed plants showed poor growth compared to non-transformant rice after germination. OsIRO2 overexpression also resulted in improved tolerance to low Fe availability in calcareous soil. In addition to increased Fe content in shoots, the overexpression plants accumulated higher amounts of Fe in seeds than non-transformants when grown on calcareous soil. These results suggest that OsIRO2 is synchronously expressed with genes involved in Fe homeostasis, and performs a crucial function in regulation not only of Fe uptake from soil but also Fe transport during germination and Fe translocation to grain during seed maturation.
NA	Rice NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE 2 expression improves dietary iron and zinc levels in wheat.	2016	Theor Appl Genet	Plant Biotechnology, Department of Biology, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.	Iron and zinc deficiencies negatively impact human health worldwide. We developed wheat lines that meet or exceed recommended dietary target levels for iron and zinc in the grains. These lines represent useful germplasm for breeding new wheat varieties that can reduce iron and zinc deficiency-associated health burdens in the affected populations. Micronutrient deficiencies, including iron and zinc deficiencies, have negative impacts on human health globally. Iron-deficiency; anemia affects nearly two billion people worldwide and is the cause of reduced cognitive development, fatigue and overall low productivity. Similarly, zinc deficiency causes stunted growth, decreased immunity and increased risk of respiratory infections. Biofortification of staple crops is a sustainable and effective approach to reduce the burden of health problems associated with micronutrient deficiencies. Here, we developed wheat lines expressing rice NICOTIANAMINE SYNTHASE 2 (OsNAS2) and bean FERRITIN (PvFERRITIN) as single genes as well as in combination. NAS catalyzes the biosynthesis of nicotianamine (NA), which is a precursor of the iron chelator deoxymugeneic acid (DMA) required for long distance iron translocation. FERRITIN is important for iron storage in plants because it can store up to 4500 iron ions. We obtained significant increases of iron and zinc content in wheat grains of plants expressing either OsNAS2 or PvFERRTIN, or both genes. In particular, wheat lines expressing OsNAS2 greatly surpass the HarvestPlus recommended target level of 30<U+00A0>% dietary estimated average requirement (EAR) for iron, and 40<U+00A0>% of EAR for zinc, with lines containing 93.1<U+00A0>¦Ìg/g of iron and 140.6<U+00A0>¦Ìg/g of zinc in the grains. These wheat lines with dietary significant levels of iron and zinc represent useful germplasm for breeding new wheat varieties that can reduce micronutrient deficiencies in affected populations.
NA	Comparative transcriptome profile analysis of rice varieties with different tolerance to zinc deficiency	2020	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	CAAS-IRRI Joint Laboratory for Genomics-Assisted Germplasm Enhancement, Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Zinc (Zn) is an indispensable element for rice growth. Zn deficiency results in brown blotches and streaks 2-3 weeks after transplanting, as well as stunting, reduced tillering, and low productivity of rice plants. These processes are controlled by different families of expressed genes. A comparative transcriptome profile analysis was conducted using the roots of two Zn deficiency tolerant varieties (UCP122 and KALIBORO26) and two sensitive varieties (IR26 and IR64) by merging data from untreated control (CK) and Zn deficiency treated samples. Results revealed a total of 4,688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal Zn and deficient conditions, with 2,702 and 1,489 unique DEGs upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified transcription factors (TFs), such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, and bHLH which are important in the regulation of the Zn deficiency response. Furthermore, chitinases, jasmonic acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways were found to be important in the Zn deficiency response. The metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes also appeared to play an important role in conferring tolerance to Zn deficiency. A heavy metal-associated domain-containing protein 7 was associated with tolerance to Zn deficiency and negatively regulated downstream genes. Collectively, our findings provide valuable expression patterns and candidate genes for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to Zn deficiency and for improvements in breeding for tolerance to Zn deficiency in rice.
