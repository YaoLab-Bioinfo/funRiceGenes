Two cDNA clones (OsNIN1 and OsNIN3) encoding an alkaline/neutral invertase localized in organelles were identified from rice. The deduced amino acid sequences of these cDNA clones showed high homology to other plant alkaline/neutral invertases. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that the expression of OsNIN1 was constitutive and independent of organ difference, although its expression level was low. Analyses using five types of web software for the prediction of protein localization in the cell, Predotar, PSORT, Mitoprot, TargetP, and ChloroP, strongly supported the possibility that OsNIN1 is transported into the mitochondria and that OsNIN3 is transported into plastids. Transient expression of fusion proteins combining the amino terminal region of these two proteins with sGFP demonstrated that N-OsNIN1::GFP and N-OsNIN3::GFP fusion proteins were transported into the mitochondria and plastids, respectively. We expressed the OsNIN1 protein in vitro and revealed that the translated protein had an invertase activity. These results clearly indicate that some of alkaline/neutral invertases are located in plant organelles, mitochondria and plastids, and that they might have a novel physiological function in plant organelles.
