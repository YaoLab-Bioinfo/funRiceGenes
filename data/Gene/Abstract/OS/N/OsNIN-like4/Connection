OsNHX1	OsNIN-like4|OsNLP5	Five novel transcription factors as potential regulators of OsNHX1 gene expression in a salt tolerant rice genotype.	This approach allowed us to identify five TFs belonging to three distinct TF families: one TCP (OsPCF2), one CPP (OsCPP5) and three NIN-like (OsNIN-like2, OsNIN-like3 and OsNIN-like4) binding to the OsNHX1 gene promoter
OsNHX1	OsNIN-like4|OsNLP5	Five novel transcription factors as potential regulators of OsNHX1 gene expression in a salt tolerant rice genotype.	Five transcription factors (TFs) belonging to three distinct TF families: one TCP (OsPCF2), one CPP (OsCPP5) and three NIN-like (OsNIN-like2, OsNIN-like3 and OsNIN-like4) were identified as binding to OsNHX1 promoter
OsNHX1	OsNIN-like4|OsNLP5	Five novel transcription factors as potential regulators of OsNHX1 gene expression in a salt tolerant rice genotype.	Transactivation activity assays performed in Arabidopsis and rice protoplasts showed that OsPCF2 and OsNIN-like4 are activators of the OsNHX1 gene expression, while OsCPP5 and OsNIN-like2 act as repressors
OsNHX1	OsNIN-like4|OsNLP5	Five novel transcription factors as potential regulators of OsNHX1 gene expression in a salt tolerant rice genotype.	In addition, although the OsNHX1 response to salt and PEG-induced drought stress in either shoots or roots was quite similar in both rice genotypes, the expression of OsPCF2 in roots under salt stress and the OsNIN-like4 in roots subjected to PEG was mainly up-regulated in Hasawi, indicating that these TFs may be associated with the salt and drought stress tolerance observed for this genotype
