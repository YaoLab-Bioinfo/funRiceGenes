The antagonism between gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathways is vital to balance plant growth and stress response. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which plants determine the balance remains to be elucidated. Here, and ABA-mediated balance between plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance. OsNF-YA3 loss-of-function mutants exhibit stunted growth, compromised GA biosynthetic gene expression, and decreased GA levels, while its overexpression lines have promoted growth and enhanced GA content. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and transient transcriptional regulation assays demonstrate that OsNF-YA3 activates GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox1 expression. Furthermore, the DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) physically interacts with OsNF-YA3 and thus inhibits its transcriptional activity. On the other side, OsNF-YA3 negatively regulates plant osmotic stress tolerance by repressing ABA response. OsNF-YA3 reduces ABA levels by transcriptionally regulating ABA catabolic genes OsABA8ox1 and OsABA8ox3 by binding to their promoters. Furthermore, OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 9 (SAPK9), the positive component in ABA signaling, interacts with OsNF-YA3 and mediates OsNF-YA3 phosphorylation, resulting in its degradation in plants. Collectively, our findings establish OsNF-YA3 as an important transcription factor that positively modulates GA-regulated plant growth and negatively controls ABA-mediated water-deficit and salt tolerance. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying the balance between the growth and stress response of the plant.
