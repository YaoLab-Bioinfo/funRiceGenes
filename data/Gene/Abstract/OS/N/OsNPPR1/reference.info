Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins constitute one of the largest protein families in land plants. Recent studies revealed the functions of PPR proteins in organellar RNA metabolism and plant development, but the functions of most PPR proteins, especially PPRs localized in the nucleus, remain largely unknown. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a rice mutant named floury and growth retardation1 (fgr1). fgr1 showed floury endosperm with loosely arranged starch grains, decreased starch and amylose contents, and retarded seedling growth. Map-based cloning showed the mutant phenotype was caused by a single nucleotide substitution in the coding region of Os08g0290000. This gene encodes a nucleus-localized PPR protein we named it OsNPPR1 that affected mitochondrial function. In vitro SELEX and RNA-EMSA assays showed that OsNPPR1 was an RNA protein that bound to the CUCAC motif determined. Moreover, a number of retained intron (RI) events were detected in fgr1. Thus, OsNPPR1 was involved in regulation of mitochondrial development and/or functions that are important for endosperm development. Our results provide novel insights into coordinated interaction between nucleus-localized PPR proteins and mitochondrial function.
