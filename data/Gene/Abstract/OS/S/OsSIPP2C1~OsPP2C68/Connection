OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice	OsSIPP2C1 expression was up-regulated by high salt, PEG6000 and exogenous ABA, and enhanced in the abl1 mutant under normal, salt, or drought condition
OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice	Together, it is suggested that a nuclear PP2C protein OsSIPP2C1 negatively regulated by ABL1 is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice
OsNAP	OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway	Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
OsABI2|OsPP2C06|OsABIL1	OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway	Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
OsPP2C09|OsPP15|OsPYL2	OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	The NAC family transcription factor OsNAP confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway	Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing OsNAP revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59)
OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	XB15|PP2C	ABA inducible rice protein phosphatase 2C confers ABA insensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.	We have identified a group A PP2C from rice (OsPP108), which is highly inducible under ABA, salt and drought stresses and localized predominantly in the nucleus
OsABF1|OsABI5|OREB1|OsbZIP10	OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	The OsABF1 transcription factor improves drought tolerance by activating the transcription of COR413-TM1 in rice.	 In addition, OsABF1 directly regulates the expression of the protein phosphatase 2C (OsPP48 and OsPP108) and bZIP (OsbZIP23, OsbZIP46, and OsbZIP72) genes, thus forming a complex feedback circuit in the drought/abscisic acid signaling pathway
OsNAC3	OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	A NAC transcription factor OsNAC3 positively regulates ABA response and salt tolerance in rice.	 Furthermore, qRT-PCR and transcriptomic analysis were performed to identify the key OsNAC3 regulated genes related to ABA response and salt tolerance, such as OsHKT1;4, OsHKT1;5, OsLEA3-1, OsPM-1, OsPP2C68, and OsRAB-21
