DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsSHI1	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Moreover, OsSHI1 could bind directly to the promoter regions of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1 through a novel cis-element (T/GCTCTAC motif)
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	OsSHI1	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Further, OsSHI1 represses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1 by affecting its DNA binding activity towards the promoters of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1, resulting in increased tiller number and diminished panicle size
OsSHI1	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.
OsSHI1	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 We show that OsSHI1 physically interacts with IPA1 both in vitro and in vivo
OsSHI1	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Further, OsSHI1 represses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1 by affecting its DNA binding activity towards the promoters of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1, resulting in increased tiller number and diminished panicle size
OsSHI1	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Taken together, our results demonstrate that OsSHI1 regulates plant architecture through modulating the transcriptional activity of IPA1 and provide novel insight into the establishment of plant architecture in rice
OsSHI1	OsTB1|FC1|SCM3	OsSHI1 Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.	 Moreover, OsSHI1 could bind directly to the promoter regions of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1 through a novel cis-element (T/GCTCTAC motif)
