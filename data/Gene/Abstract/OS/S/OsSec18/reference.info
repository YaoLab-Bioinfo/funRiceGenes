NA	The OsSec18 complex interacts with P0(P1-P2)2 to regulate vacuolar morphology in  rice endosperm cell	2015	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice and College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Luojia Hill, Wuhan, Hubei Province, 430072, China	In the present study, we investigated the function of OsSec18 in rice and found that OsSec18 complements the temperature-sensitive phenotype and interferes with vacuolar morphogenesis in yeast. Overexpression of OsSec18 in rice decreased the plant height and 1000-grain weight and altered the morphology  of the protein bodies. Further examination revealed that OsSec18 presented as a 290-kDa complex in rice endosperm cells. Moreover, Os60sP0 was identified a component of this complex, demonstrating that the OsSec18 complex contains another complex of P0(P1-P2)2 in rice endosperm cells. Furthermore, we determined that the N-terminus of OsSec18 can interact with the N- and C-termini of Os60sP0, whereas the C-terminus of OsSec18 can only interact with the C-terminus of Os60sP0.
NA	The OsSec18 complex interacts with P0(P1-P2)2 to regulate vacuolar morphology in rice endosperm cell.	2015	BMC Plant Biol	Fail	Sec18p/N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) is a conserved eukaryotic ATPase, which primarily functions in vesicle membrane fusion from yeast to human. However, the function of the OsSec18 gene, a homologue of NSF in rice, remains unknown.In the present study, we investigated the function of OsSec18 in rice and found that OsSec18 complements the temperature-sensitive phenotype and interferes with vacuolar morphogenesis in yeast. Overexpression of OsSec18 in rice decreased the plant height and 1000-grain weight and altered the morphology of the protein bodies. Further examination revealed that OsSec18 presented as a 290-kDa complex in rice endosperm cells. Moreover, Os60sP0 was identified a component of this complex, demonstrating that the OsSec18 complex contains another complex of P0(P1-P2)2 in rice endosperm cells. Furthermore, we determined that the N-terminus of OsSec18 can interact with the N- and C-termini of Os60sP0, whereas the C-terminus of OsSec18 can only interact with the C-terminus of Os60sP0.Our results revealed that the OsSec18 regulates vacuolar morphology in both yeast and rice endosperm cell and the OsSec18 interacts with P0(P1-P2)2 complex in rice endosperm cell.
