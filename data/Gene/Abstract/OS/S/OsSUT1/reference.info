Taipei 309	2012	Plant Sci	Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology (MPIMP), Wissenschaftspark Golm, Am Muehlenberg 1, Potsdam-Golm D-14476, Germany. siahpoosh@scu.ac.ir	A metabolic depletion syndrome was discovered at early vegetative stages in roots of salt sensitive rice cultivars after prolonged exposure to 100mM NaCl. Metabolite profiling analyses demonstrate that this syndrome is part of the terminal stages of the rice salt response. The phenotype encompasses depletion of at least 30 primary metabolites including sucrose, glucose, fructose, glucose-6-P, fructose-6P, organic- and amino-acids. Based on these observations we reason that sucrose allocation to the root may modify the rice response to high salt. This hypothesis was tested using antisense lines of the salt responsive OsSUT1 gene in the salt sensitive Taipei 309 cultivar. Contrary to our expectations of a plant system impaired in one component of sucrose transport, we find improved gas exchange and photosynthetic performance as well as maintenance of sucrose levels in the root under high salinity. Two independent OsSUT1 lines with an antisense inhibition similar to the naturally occurring salt induced reduction of OsSUT1 gene expression showed these phenomena but not a more extreme antisense inhibition line. We investigated the metabolic depletion syndrome by metabolomic and physiological approaches and discuss our results with regard to the potential role of sucrose transporters and sucrose transport for rice salt acclimation.

The sugar transporters identified as being specific to the seed development may play a crucial role for flowering and grain development. The rice sucrose transporterOsSUT1 and the monosaccharide transportersOsMST1-3 have been previously characterized. To investigate sugar transport processes during flowering and in developing grains of rice, we newly isolated two genomic clonesOsSUT2(Oryzasativasucrosetransporter 2) andOsMST5(Oryzasativamonosaccharidetransporter 5) and their corresponding cDNAs.OsSUT2 andOsMST5are encoded by open reading frames of 1485 and 1557 bp encoding 495 and 519amino acids, respectively. The putative amino acid sequence ofOsSUT2showed 63.0 and 62.4 percnt; identity to that ofOsSUT1and barley transporterHvSUT1, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed thatOsSUT2andOsMST5mRNA accumulates in panicles before pollination.In situ hybridization analysis showed thatOsSUT2transcript is specific to the developing pollen. These data presented suggest that bothOsSUT2andOsMST5 play a role during the development at the early stage of the seed development. On the other handOsSUT1 was expressed at the early stage of the grain development, suggesting a different physiological role compared to Os SUT2.
1-s2.0-S017616171300268X-main.pdf	Assimilate translocation and expression of sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, contribute to high-performance ripening under heat stress in the heat-tolerant rice cultivar Genkitsukushi	2013	J Plant Physiol	Fukuoka Agricultural Research Center, Chikushino, Fukuoka 818-8549, Japan; Crop Science Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.	High temperature reduces the grain quality of rice, a situation likely to become more frequent because of global warming. We studied the effects of high-temperature stress on grain quality of heat-tolerant cultivar 'Genkitsukushi' and heat-sensitive cultivar 'Tsukushiroman'. When day/night temperatures were 31/26 degrees C from heading until maturity, the grain quality of 'Genkitsukushi' was rated at the first inspection grade (high quality), whereas 'Tsukushiroman' showed a remarkable increase in the percentage of white immature kernels (low quality). Nonstructural carbohydrate content in the stem of 'Genkitsukushi' the early maturation was significantly higher than in 'Tsukushiroman' and greatly decreased under high temperature. From 14 to 21 days after heading, the expression of the sucrose transporter gene, OsSUT1, was higher in the stem of 'Genkitsukushi' grown under high temperature than in 'Tsukushiroman'. In addition, the expression of OsSUT1 in the grains of 'Genkitsukushi' was significantly higher than in 'Tsukushiroman' during the ripening period. These results indicate that sugar transport functions more effectively in 'Genkitsukushi' than in 'Tsukushiroman', and that the effectiveness of sugar transport contributes to maintaining high grain quality in 'Genkitsukushi' under high-temperature conditions.
1471-2091-13-26.pdf	Arg188 in rice sucrose transporter OsSUT1 is crucial for substrate transport	2012	BMC Biochem	Department of Plant Biology, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, St, Paul, MN 55108, USA.	BACKGROUND: Plant sucrose uptake transporters (SUTs) are H+/sucrose symporters related to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). SUTs are essential for plant growth but little is known about their transport mechanism. Recent work identified several conserved, charged amino acids within transmembrane spans (TMS) in SUTs that are essential for transport activity. Here we further evaluated the role of one of these positions, R188 in the fourth TMS of OsSUT1, a type II SUT. RESULTS: The OsSUT1(R188K) mutant, studied by expression in plants, yeast, and Xenopus oocytes, did not transport sucrose but showed a H+ leak that was blocked by sucrose. The H+ leak was also blocked by beta-phenyl glucoside which is not translocated by OsSUT1. Replacing the corresponding Arg in type I and type III SUTs, AtSUC1(R163K) and LjSUT4(R169K), respectively, also resulted in loss of sucrose transport activity. Fluorination at the glucosyl 3 and 4 positions of alpha-phenyl glucoside greatly decreased transport by wild type OsSUT1 but did not affect the ability to block H+ leak in the R188K mutant. CONCLUSION: OsSUT1 R188 appears to be essential for sucrose translocation but not for substrate interaction that blocks H+ leak. Therefore, we propose that an additional binding site functions in the initial recognition of substrates. The corresponding Arg in type I and III SUTs are equally important. We propose that R188 interacts with glucosyl 3-OH and 4-OH during translocation.
bi201934h.pdf	Functionally important amino acids in rice sucrose transporter OsSUT1	2012	Biochemistry	Department of Plant Biology, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, St. Paul, Minnesota 55108, United States.	Six conserved, charged amino acids within membrane spans in rice sucrose transporter OsSUT1 were identified using a three-dimensional structural model based on the crystal structures of three major facilitator superfamily (MFS) proteins: LacY, GlpT, and EmrD. These positions in OsSUT1 were selected for mutagenesis and biochemical assays. Among the six mutants, D177N completely lost transport function, D331N retained only a small fraction of sucrose uptake activity (2.3% of that of the wild type), and R335H and E336Q also displayed a substantial decrease in transport activity. D329N functioned as well as wild-type OsSUT1. R188K did not transport sucrose but showed a H(+) leak that was inhibited by sucrose, indicating that R188K had uncoupled sucrose and H(+) translocation. This demonstrates that charged amino acids within membrane spans are important for the transport mechanism of OsSUT1 as they are in lactose permease.
J. Exp. Bot.-2006-Scofield-jxb-erl217.pdf	The role of the sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, in germination and early seedling growth and development of rice plants	2007	J Exp Bot	CSIRO Plant Industry, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.	Using expression analysis, the role of the sucrose transporter OsSUT1 during germination and early growth of rice seedlings has been examined in detail, over a time-course ranging from 1 d to 7 d post-imbibition. Unlike the wheat orthologue, TaSUT1, which is thought to be directly involved in sugar transfer across the scutellar epithelium, OsSUT1 is not expressed in the scutellar epithelial cell layer of germinating rice and is, therefore, not involved in transport of sugars across the symplastic discontinuity between the endosperm and the embryo. OsSUT1 expression was also absent from the aleurone cells, indicating it is not involved in the transport of sucrose in this cell layer during germination. However, by 3 d post-imbibition, OsSUT1 was present in the companion cells and sieve elements of the scutellar vascular bundle, where it may play a role in phloem loading of sucrose for transport to the developing shoot and roots. This sucrose is most likely sourced from hexoses imported from the endosperm. In addition, sucrose may be remobilized from starch granules which are present at a high density in the scutellar ground tissues surrounding the vasculature and at the base of the shoot. OsSUT1 was also present in the coleoptile and the first and second leaf blades, where it was localized to the phloem along the entire length of these tissues, and was also present within the phloem of the primary roots. OsSUT1 may be involved in retrieval of sugars from the apoplasm in these tissues.
J. Exp. Bot.-2007-Scofield-3155-69.pdf	Involvement of the sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, in the long-distance pathway for assimilate transport in rice	2007	J Exp Bot	CSIRO Plant Industry, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.	The roles of the rice sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, have previously been examined in filling grain, germination, and early seedling growth. In the current work, the role that OsSUT1 plays in the transport of assimilate along the entire long-distance pathway, from the flag leaf blade to the base of the filling grain, was investigated. OsSUT1 promoter::GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter gene analysis and immunolocalization revealed that both OsSUT1 promoter::GUS activity and OsSUT protein were present in the mature phloem of all the vegetative tissues involved in the long-distance assimilate transport pathway during grain filling. In addition, expression was observed in the flag leaf blade and sheath prior to heading. The OsSUT1 promoter::GUS activity appeared to be largely confined to the companion cells within the phloem, whereas the protein localized to both the sieve tubes and the companion cells. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the OsSUT1 transcript is expressed in the uppermost internode of the rice plant (internode-1). These OsSUT localization data were related to measurements of starch and soluble sugar content of these tissues, and localization of the carbohydrate reserves stored in the stem. Results from dye feeding experiments, to examine cellular connections, revealed a symplastic continuity between the phloem and surrounding parenchyma in the flag leaf blade, sheath, and internode-1 tissues. It is proposed that OsSUT1 may primarily play a role in phloem loading of sucrose retrieved from the apoplasm along the transport pathway.
J. Exp. Bot.-2010-Hirose-3639-46.pdf	Disruption of a gene for rice sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, impairs pollen function but pollen maturation is unaffected	2010	J Exp Bot	Hokuriku Research Center, National Agricultural Research Center, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Joetsu, Niigata 943-0193, Japan. dragon@affrc.go.jp	Sucrose transporters (SUTs) are known to play critical roles in the uptake of sucrose from the apoplast in various steps of sugar translocation. Because developing pollen is symplastically isolated from anther tissues, it is hypothesized that SUTs are active in the uptake of apoplastic sucrose into pollen. To investigate this possibility, a comprehensive expression analysis was performed for members of the SUT gene family in the developing pollen of rice (Oryza sativa L.) using real-time RT-PCR combined with a laser microdissection technique. Among the five SUT genes, OsSUT1 and OsSUT3 were found to be preferentially expressed and had temporal expression patterns that were distinct from each other. Expression of OsSUT1 in pollen was confirmed by a promoter-GUS fusion assay. The physiological function of OsSUT1 in pollen was further investigated using retrotransposon insertion mutant lines. While the homozygote of disrupted OsSUT1 (SUT1-/-) could not be obtained, heterozygote plants (SUT1+/-) showed normal grain filling. Their progeny segregated into SUT1+/- and SUT1+/+ with the ratio of 1:1, suggesting that the pollen disrupted for OsSUT1 is dysfunctional. This hypothesis was reinforced in vivo by a backcross of SUT1+/- plants with wild-type plants and also by in vitro pollen germination on the artificial media. However, starch accumulation during pollen development was not affected by disruption of OsSUT1, suggesting that the sugar(s) required for starch biosynthesis is supplied by other sugar transporters.
Plant Cell Physiol-2001-Ishimaru-1181-5.pdf	Antisense Expression of a Rice Sucrose Transporter OsSUT1 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2001	Plant and Cell Physiology	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan	We analyzed the function of a rice sucrose transporter, OsSUT1, by using antisense rice. There was no difference between antisense and wild-type plants in carbohydrate content and photosynthetic ability of the flag leaves in the vegetative growth stage, suggesting that OsSUT1 may not play an important role in carbon metabolism, at least in these materials.
Plant Cell Physiol-2003-Aoki-223-32.pdf	The sucrose transporter gene family in rice	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	CSIRO Plant Industry, Canberra, ACT, 2601 Australia.	In this paper we report the identification, cloning and expression analysis of four putative sucrose transporter (SUT) genes from rice, designated OsSUT2, 3, 4 and 5. Three of the four genes were identified through extensive searches of the recently published draft sequence of the rice genome. Along with the previously reported OsSUT1 we propose that these five genes comprise the rice SUT gene family. Complementary DNA clones were isolated for the four newly identified genes. The deduced proteins of all five SUT genes were predicted to contain 12 membrane-spanning helices and a domain highly conserved throughout all known plant SUTs, suggesting the four additional OsSUT genes encode functional SUTs. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed in order to investigate the expression pattern of each member of the SUT family in rice. A differing but overlapping expression pattern was observed for each member of the SUT family at different stages through plant development. These results, together with the structural variations apparent from the deduced protein sequences, suggest that the five SUTs possess diverse roles in both sink and source tissues. We also discuss the classification and evolution of the rice SUT gene family, using a comparison of the gene structures and deduced amino acid sequences with other known plant SUT genes.
Plant Cell Physiol-2010-Sun-114-22.pdf	Transport activity of rice sucrose transporters OsSUT1 and OsSUT5	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Plant Biology, University of Minnesota, 250 Biological Sciences Center, St. Paul, MN 55108 USA.	Expression in Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology was used to test for transport activity of the five sucrose transporter (SUT) homologs from rice. Expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT5 resulted in sucrose-dependent currents that were analyzed by two-electrode voltage clamping. We examined the transport kinetics, substrate specificity and pH dependence of sucrose transport and K(0.5) for sucrose. OsSUT1 showed similar features to those of other type II SUTs from monocots examined previously, with a K(0.5) value of 7.50 mM at pH 5.6. In contrast, OsSUT5 had a higher substrate affinity (K(0.5) = 2.32 mM at pH 5.6), less substrate specificity and less pH dependence compared with all type II SUTs tested to date. Regulation of the rice SUTs, as well as ZmSUT1 from maize and HvSUT1 from barley, by reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms of glutathione was tested. GSSG and GSH were found to have no significant effect on the activity of sucrose transporters when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In conclusion, differences in transport activity between OsSUT1 and OsSUT5 indicate that type II SUTs have a range of transport activities that are tuned to their function in the plant.
plb12117.pdf	Rice sucrose transporter1 (OsSUT1) up-regulation in xylem parenchyma is caused by aphid feeding on rice leaf blade vascular bundles	2014	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Department of Botany, Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa; Plant Stress Response Group, Department of Biochemistry & Microbiology, University of Fort Hare, Alice, South Africa.	The role of the sucrose transporter OsSUT1 in assimilate retrieval via the xylem, as a result of damage to and leakage from punctured phloem was examined after rusty plum aphid (Hysteroneura setariae, Thomas) infestation on leaves from 3-week-old rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Nipponbare) plants. Leaves were examined over a 1- to 10-day infestation time course, using a combination of gene expression and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene analyses. qPCR and Western blot analyses revealed differential expression of OsSUT1 during aphid infestation. Wide-field fluorescence microscopy was used to confirm the expression of OsSUT1-promoter::GUS reporter gene in vascular parenchyma associated with xylem elements, as well as in companion cells associated with phloem sieve tubes of large, intermediate and small vascular bundles within the leaf blade, in regions where the aphids had settled and were feeding. Of great interest was up-regulation of OsSUT1 expression associated with the xylem parenchyma cells, abutting the metaxylem vessels, which confirmed that OsSUT1 was not only involved in loading of sugars into the phloem under normal physiological conditions, but was apparently involved in the retrieval of sucrose leaked into the xylem conduits, which occurred as a direct result of aphid feeding, probing and puncturing of vascular bundles. The up-regulation of OsSUT1 in xylem vascular parenchyma thus provides evidence in support of the location within the xylem parenchyma cells of an efficient mechanism to ensure sucrose recovery after loss to the apoplast (xylem) after aphid-related feeding damage and its transfer back to the symplast (phloem) in O. sativa leaves.
PP01204.pdf	Antisense suppression of the rice transporter gene, OsSUT1, leads to impaired grain filling and germination but does not affect photosynthesis	2002	Functional Plant Biology	None	OsSUT1 encodes a rice sucrose transport protein that is highly expressed in developing grain, leaf sheath and stem after heading, and in germinating seedlings, but only at very low levels in source leaves. In this study, we have used antisense gene suppression to elucidate the in vivo function of OsSUT1. Rice was transformed with an antisense construct containing a portion of the 3â€‘ù<U+3E32>-coding and non-coding regions of OsSUT1 driven by the maize ubiquitin-1 promoter. Twenty-six independent stably transformed lines were obtained. T0 and selfed T1 progeny were analysed for suppression of OsSUT1 expression and function. Many of the plants showed a significant reduction in their ability to produce filled grain, and final grain weight was reduced. Severe phenotypes correlated with a reduction in OsSUT1 transcript level in filling grain. Unlike SUT1 antisense suppression in dicots, source supply of photosynthate was unaffected in these transformants. This provides the first direct evidence for the requirement of a sucrose transporter for grain filling in a cereal species. Furthermore, seed from some of the T0 population showed a reduction in the rate of germination and growth, supporting the hypothesis that OsSUT1 may also play a role in transporting sucrose remobilized from starch reserves in germinating seeds.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
