OsARF12	OsSPX-MFS1|OsPSS1	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2
LTN1|OsPHO2|OsRLS1	OsSPX-MFS1|OsPSS1	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2
OsSPX-MFS1|OsPSS1	OsSPX-MFS2	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2
OsSPX-MFS1|OsPSS1	OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	Functional characterization of the rice SPX-MFS family reveals a key role of OsSPX-MFS1 in controlling phosphate homeostasis in leaves	* Transcript analyses revealed that members of the SPX-MFS family were mainly expressed in the shoots, with OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS3 being suppressed by Pi deficiency, while OsSPX-MFS2 was induced
OsSPX-MFS1|OsPSS1	OsSPX-MFS2	Complex regulation of two target genes encoding SPX-MFS proteins by rice miR827 in response to phosphate starvation	Here we report on the characterization of rice osa-miR827 and its two target genes, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2, which encode SPX-MFS proteins predicted to be implicated in phosphate (Pi) sensing or transport
OsSPX-MFS1|OsPSS1	OsSPX-MFS2	Complex regulation of two target genes encoding SPX-MFS proteins by rice miR827 in response to phosphate starvation	In parallel, we analyzed the responses of the two OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2 gene targets to Pi starvation
OsSPX-MFS1|OsPSS1	OsSPX-MFS2	Complex regulation of two target genes encoding SPX-MFS proteins by rice miR827 in response to phosphate starvation	This suggests that OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2 are both negatively regulated by osa-miR827 abundance although they respond differently to external Pi conditions
OsSPX-MFS1|OsPSS1	OsSPX-MFS3|OsPSS3	OsSPX-MFS3, a vacuolar phosphate efflux transporter, is involved in maintaining Pi homeostasis in rice.	OsSPX-MFS1, OsSPX-MFS2 and OsSPX-MFS3 all localized on the tonoplast of rice protoplasts, even in the absence of the SPX domain
