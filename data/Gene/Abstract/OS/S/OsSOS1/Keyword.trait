OsNHA1|OsSOS1	transporter	Conservation of the salt overly sensitive pathway in rice	The rice transporter, denoted by OsSOS1, demonstrated a capacity for Na+/H+ exchange in plasma membrane vesicles of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells and reduced their net cellular Na+ content
OsNHA1|OsSOS1	salt	Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress
OsNHA1|OsSOS1	seedling	Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress
OsNHA1|OsSOS1	leaf	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	In addition, lower expression of OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1 in old leaves may decrease frequency of retrieving Na+ from old leaf cells
OsNHA1|OsSOS1	salt	Conservation of the salt overly sensitive pathway in rice	Moreover, OsSOS1 suppressed the salt sensitivity of a sos1-1 mutant of Arabidopsis
OsNHA1|OsSOS1	salt	Conservation of the salt overly sensitive pathway in rice	OsCIPK24 and OsCBL4 acted coordinately to activate OsSOS1 in yeast cells and they could be exchanged with their Arabidopsis counterpart to form heterologous protein kinase modules that activated both OsSOS1 and AtSOS1 and suppressed the salt sensitivity of sos2 and sos3 mutants of Arabidopsis
OsNHA1|OsSOS1	shoot	Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress
OsNHA1|OsSOS1	salt stress	Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress
OsNHA1|OsSOS1	root	Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress
OsNHA1|OsSOS1	drought	Isolation and characterization of a new Na+/H+ antiporter gene OsNHA1 from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay revealed that the expression of OsNHA1 was up-regulated in both shoots and roots of rice seedlings under salt stress, whereas it was not induced in the rice seedlings treated by drought stress
OsNHA1|OsSOS1	alkaline stress	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase OsDMI3 positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots	 Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsDMI3 up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants
