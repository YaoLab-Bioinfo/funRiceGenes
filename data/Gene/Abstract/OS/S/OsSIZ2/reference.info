Although there have been a number of reports about the functions of SIZ1 in Arabidopsis in the regulation of diverse life processes, no information regarding the role of SIZ in other plants is available yet. In this work, two homologous genes from rice (Oryza sativa) were isolated and designated as OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 based on amino acid sequence homology to AtSIZ1 and their phylogenetic relationship. The function in the vegetative growth and reproductive development in rice was investigated using OsSIZ1 mutants containing a T-DNA insertion. The results showed that the mutant Ossiz1 exhibited the significant changes in several growth and developmental parameters, including primary root length, adventitious root number, plant height, leaf and panicle length, flower formation, and seed-setting rate compared with wild type. Taking together these results indicate that OsSIZ1 plays an important role in regulating growth and development in rice.

The PIAS [protein inhibitor of activated signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)] and SAP (scaffold attachment factor A/B/acinus/PIAS)/MIZ (SIZ) proteins exhibit SUMO E3-ligase activity that facilitates the conjugation of SUMO proteins to target substrates. Here, we report the isolation and molecular characterization of Oryza sativa SIZ1 (OsSIZ1) and SIZ2 (OsSIZ2), rice homologs of Arabidopsis SIZ1. The rice SIZ proteins are localized to the nucleus and showed sumoylation activities in a tobacco system. Our analysis showed increased amounts of SUMO conjugates associated with environmental stresses such as high and low temperature, NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) in rice plants. The expression of OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 in siz1-2 Arabidopsis plants partially complemented the morphological mutant phenotype and enhanced levels of SUMO conjugates under heat shock conditions. In addition, ABA-hypersensitivity of siz1-2 seed germination was partially suppressed by OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2. The results suggest that rice SIZ1 and SIZ2 are able to functionally complement Arabidopsis SIZ1 in the SUMO conjugation pathway. Their effects on the Arabidopsis mutant suggest a function for these genes related to stress responses and stress adaptation.
NA	OsSIZ2 exerts regulatory influences on the developmental responses and phosphate homeostasis in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, 210095, Nanjing, China.	OsSIZ1, a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase, exerts regulatory influences on the developmental responses and phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa). Whether paralogs OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 are functionally redundant or the latter regulates these traits independent of the former is not known. To determine this, in this study, OsSIZ2 was functionally characterized by employing reverse genetic approaches. Although the relative expression of OsSIZ2 was spatiotemporally regulated, it showed constitutive expression in root and leaf blade irrespective of Pi regime. Analysis of T-DNA insertion knockout (ossiz2) and RNAi-mediated knockdown (Ri1-3) mutants revealed positive influences on growth and developmental responses including yield-related traits. On the contrary, these mutants exhibited negative effects on the concentrations of Pi and total P in different tissues. The relative expression levels of some of the genes that are involved in Pi sensing and signaling cascades were differentially modulated in the mutants. Further, attenuation in the expression levels of OsSIZ2 in the roots of ossiz1 and relatively similar trend of the effects of the mutation in OsSIZ1 and OsSIZ2 on growth and development and total P concentration in different tissues suggested a prevalence of partial functional redundancy between these paralogs.
NA	OsSIZ2 regulates nitrogen homeostasis and some of the reproductive traits in rice.	2018	J Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, 210095, China.	Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) is a post-translational modification of proteins that has important roles in plant growth and development as well as nutrition study. OsSIZ1, a SUMO E3 ligase in rice (Oryza sativa), exerts regulatory influence on nitrogen (N) homeostasis. Here, we investigated the biological function of OsSIZ2, a paralog of OsSIZ1, in the responses to nitrogen, anther dehiscence, and seed length using a reverse genetics approach. The expression of OsSIZ2 was increased during N deficiency. Under -N condition, total N concentration in the root of OsSIZ2-Ri plants and ossiz2 was significantly increased compared with wild type. Further, 15N-labelled uptake assay revealed the role of OsSIZ2 in acquisition and mobilization of N. Moreover, qRT-PCR analyses revealed that several genes involved in the maintenance of N homeostasis were altered in OsSIZ2 mutants. In addition, ossiz2 indicated obvious defects in anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed set percentage. Interestingly, however, the seed length was longer in the mutant compared with wild type. Overall, these results suggest pivotal roles of OsSIZ2 in regulating homeostasis of N and different agronomic traits including anther and seed development.
