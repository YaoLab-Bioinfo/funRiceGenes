ng.591.pdf	Regulation of OsSPL14 by OsmiR156 defines ideal plant architecture in rice	2010	Nat Genet	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Increasing crop yield is a major challenge for modern agriculture. The development of new plant types, which is known as ideal plant architecture (IPA), has been proposed as a means to enhance rice yield potential over that of existing high-yield varieties. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a semidominant quantitative trait locus, IPA1 (Ideal Plant Architecture 1), which profoundly changes rice plant architecture and substantially enhances rice grain yield. The IPA1 quantitative trait locus encodes OsSPL14 (SOUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 14) and is regulated by microRNA (miRNA) OsmiR156 in vivo. We demonstrate that a point mutation in OsSPL14 perturbs OsmiR156-directed regulation of OsSPL14, generating an 'ideal' rice plant with a reduced tiller number, increased lodging resistance and enhanced grain yield. Our study suggests that OsSPL14 may help improve rice grain yield by facilitating the breeding of new elite rice varieties.
ng.592.pdf	OsSPL14 promotes panicle branching and higher grain productivity in rice	2010	Nat Genet	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.	Identification of alleles that improve crop production and lead to higher-yielding varieties are needed for food security. Here we show that the quantitative trait locus WFP (WEALTHY FARMER'S PANICLE) encodes OsSPL14 (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 14, also known as IPA1). Higher expression of OsSPL14 in the reproductive stage promotes panicle branching and higher grain yield in rice. OsSPL14 controls shoot branching in the vegetative stage and is affected by microRNA excision. We also demonstrate the feasibility of using the OsSLP14(WFP) allele to increase rice crop yield. Introduction of the high-yielding OsSPL14(WFP) allele into the standard rice variety Nipponbare resulted in increased rice production.

Plant Cell-2013-Lu-3743-59.pdf	Genome-wide binding analysis of the transcription activator ideal plant architecture1 reveals a complex network regulating rice plant architecture	2013	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Ideal plant architecture1 (IPA1) is critical in regulating rice (Oryza sativa) plant architecture and substantially enhances grain yield. To elucidate its molecular basis, we first confirmed IPA1 as a functional transcription activator and then identified 1067 and 2185 genes associated with IPA1 binding sites in shoot apices and young panicles, respectively, through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays. The Squamosa promoter binding protein-box direct binding core motif GTAC was highly enriched in IPA1 binding peaks; interestingly, a previously uncharacterized indirect binding motif TGGGCC/T was found to be significantly enriched through the interaction of IPA1 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoter binding factor1 or promoter binding factor2. Genome-wide expression profiling by RNA sequencing revealed IPA1 roles in diverse pathways. Moreover, our results demonstrated that IPA1 could directly bind to the promoter of rice teosinte branched1, a negative regulator of tiller bud outgrowth, to suppress rice tillering, and directly and positively regulate dense and erect panicle1, an important gene regulating panicle architecture, to influence plant height and panicle length. The elucidation of target genes of IPA1 genome-wide will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant architecture and to facilitating the breeding of elite varieties with ideal plant architecture.
NA	Enhanced expression of OsSPL14 gene and its association with yield components in rice (Oryza sativa) under low nitrogen conditions.	2015	Gene	ICAR-Indian Institute of Rice Research, Rajendranagar, Hyderabad 500030, India.	Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in rice crop is the need of the hour for reduction of nitrous oxide emission resulting from excess nitrogen (N) fertilizer application and also in reduction of cost of cultivation. Ten rice genotypes were grown under low and recommended dose of N application and characterized in terms of parameters related to yield, yield related components and NUE indicators. Wide genetic variability under low N conditions was observed with significant variation for 15 yield related parameters in interactions of genotypes and treatment. Limitation of N has led to the decrease of all yield and yield related parameters, but for grain filling % and 1000 grain weight. Two genotypes, Rasi and Varadhan have shown minimum differences between low and recommended N conditions. Correlation analysis of various yield components showed the importance of the secondary branches for the total grains under low N. Expression analysis of OsSPL14 (LOC_Os08g39890) gene reported to be associated with increased panicle branching and higher grain yield through real time PCR in leaf and three stages of panicle has shown differential temporal expression and its association with yield and yield related components across the genotypes. The expression of OsSPL14 at panicle stage 3, has shown correlation (P&lt;0.05) with N% in grain. Since OsSPL14 is a functional transcription activator, its association of expression in leaf and three panicle stages with yield components as observed in the present study suggests the role of nitrogen metabolism related genes in plant growth and development and its conversion into yield components in rice.
NA	A natural tandem array alleviates epigenetic repression of IPA1 and leads to superior yielding rice.	2017	Nat Commun	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics and National Center of Plant Gene Research, Institute of Plant Physiology &amp;Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	Super hybrid rice varieties with ideal plant architecture (IPA) have been critical in enhancing food security worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their improved yield remain unclear. Here, we report the identification of a QTL, qWS8/ipa1-2D, in the super rice Yongyou12 (YY12) and related varieties. In-depth genetic molecular characterization of qWS8/ipa1-2D reveals that this newly identified QTL results from three distal naturally occurring tandem repeats upstream of IPA1, a key gene/locus previously shown to shape rice ideal plant architecture and greatly enhance grain yield. The qWS8/ipa1-2D locus is associated with reduced DNA methylation and a more open chromatin state at the IPA1 promoter, thus alleviating the epigenetic repression of IPA1 mediated by nearby heterochromatin. Our findings reveal that IPA traits can be fine-tuned by manipulating IPA1 expression and that an optimal IPA1 expression/dose may lead to an ideal yield, demonstrating a practical approach to efficiently design elite super rice varieties.
NA	IPA1 functions as a downstream transcription factor repressed by D53 in strigolactone signaling in rice.	2017	Cell Res	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Strigolactones (SLs), a group of carotenoid derived terpenoid lactones, are root-to-shoot phytohormones suppressing shoot branching by inhibiting the outgrowth of axillary buds. DWARF 53 (D53), the key repressor of the SL signaling pathway, is speculated to regulate the downstream transcriptional network of the SL response. However, no downstream transcription factor targeted by D53 has yet been reported. Here we report that Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1), a key regulator of the plant architecture in rice, functions as a direct downstream component of D53 in regulating tiller number and SL-induced gene expression. We showed that D53 interacts with IPA1 in vivo and in vitro and suppresses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1. We further showed that IPA1 could directly bind to the D53 promoter and plays a critical role in the feedback regulation of SL-induced D53 expression. These findings reveal that IPA1 is likely one of the long-speculated transcription factors that act with D53 to mediate the SL-regulated tiller development in rice.Cell Research advance online publication 15 August 2017; doi:10.1038/cr.2017.102.
NA	Introgression of a functional epigenetic OsSPL14WFPallele into elite indica rice genomes greatly improved panicle traits and grain yield.	2018	Sci Rep	Strategic Innovation Platform, International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), DAPO Box, 7777, Metro Manila, Philippines.	Rice yield potential has been stagnant since the Green Revolution in the late 1960s, especially in tropical rice cultivars. We evaluated the effect of two major genes that regulate grain number, Gn1a/OsCKX2 and IPA1/WFP/OsSPL14, in elite indica cultivar backgrounds. The yield-positive Gn1a-type 3 and OsSPL14WFPalleles were introgressed respectively through marker-assisted selection (MAS). The grain numbers per panicle (GNPP) were compared between the recipient allele and the donor allele groups using segregating plants in BC3F2and BC3F3generations. There was no significant difference in GNPP between the two Gn1a alleles, suggesting that the Gn1a-type 3 allele was not effective in indica cultivars. However, the OsSPL14WFPallele dramatically increased GNPP by 10.6-59.3% in all four different backgrounds across cropping seasons and generations, indicating that this allele provides strong genetic gain to elite indica cultivars. Eventually, five high-yielding breeding lines were bred using the OsSPL14WFPallele by MAS with a conventional breeding approach that showed increased grain yield by 28.4-83.5% (7.87-12.89 t/ha) vis-ид-vis the recipient cultivars and exhibited higher yield (~64.7%) than the top-yielding check cultivar, IRRI 156 (7.82 t/ha). We demonstrated a strong possibility to increase the genetic yield potential of indica rice varieties through allele mining and its application.
