OsSIN|ACE1	SLR1|OsGAI	Overexpression of OsSIN, encoding a novel small protein, causes short internodes in Oryza sativa	Expression of OsGAI at protein level was increased in OsSIN-overexpressed rice compared with the wild type
OsSIN|ACE1	OsZFP213|PINE1|DEC1	Antagonistic regulation of the gibberellic acid response during stem growth in rice 	 We also show that the mechanism of internode elongation that is mediated by ACE1 and DEC1 is conserved in the Gramineae family
OsSIN|ACE1	OsZFP213|PINE1|DEC1	Antagonistic regulation of the gibberellic acid response during stem growth in rice 	 Furthermore, an analysis of genetic diversity suggests that mutations in ACE1 and DEC1 have historically contributed to the selection of shorter plants in domesticated populations of rice to increase their resistance to lodging, and of taller plants in wild species of rice for adaptation to growth in deep water
