Deposition of H2A.Z and H4 acetylation by SWI2/SNF2-Related 1 Chromatin Remodeling (SWR1) and Nucleosome Acetyltransferase of H4 (NuA4) complexes in specific regulatory regions modulates transcription and development. However, little is known about these complexes in Oryza sativa (rice) development. Here, we reported that OsYAF9 and OsSWC4, two subunits of SWR1 and NuA4 complexes, are involved in rice vegetative and reproductive development. Loss of OsYAF9 resulted in reduced height, fewer tillers, fewer pollen grains, and defects in embryogenesis and seed filling. OsYAF9 directly interacted with OsSWC4 in vitro and in vivo. Loss of OsSWC4 function exhibited defects in pollen germination and failure to generate seeds, whereas knockdown of OsSWC4 resulted in reduced height and fewer tillers. The reduced height caused by OsYAF9 mutation and OsSWC4 knockdown was due to shorter internodes and defects in cell elongation, and this phenotype was rescued with gibberellin (GA) treatment, suggesting that both OsYAF9 and OsSWC4 are involved in the GA biosynthesis pathway. OsSWC4 was directly bound to the AT-rich region of GA biosynthesis genes, which in turn accomplished H2A.Z deposition and H4 acetylation at the GA biosynthesis genes with OsYAF9. Together, our study provides insights into the mechanisms involving OsSWC4 and OsYAF9 forming a protein complex to promote rice internode elongation with H2A.Z deposition and H4 acetylation.
