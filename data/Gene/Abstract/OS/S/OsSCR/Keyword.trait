OsSCR|OsSCR2	leaf	The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants	In leaf primordia, expression of OsSCR was observed in stomatal and ligule formation
OsSCR|OsSCR2	root	The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants	In the root tip, OsSCR expression was observed in the endodermal cell layer and downregulated in the daughter cortex cell after asymmetric division, just as with Arabidopsis SCR
OsSCR|OsSCR2	stomatal	The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants	In leaf primordia, expression of OsSCR was observed in stomatal and ligule formation
OsSCR|OsSCR2	stomatal	The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants	In stomatal development, OsSCR was specifically expressed in the stomatal cell files before formation of guard mother cells (GMCs), and then, its expression was localized in GMCs, when the first asymmetric division occurred to generate the GMCs
OsSCR|OsSCR2	iaa	A rice tryptophan deficient dwarf mutant, tdd1, contains a reduced level of indole acetic acid and develops abnormal flowers and organless embryos	In tdd1 embryos, the expression patterns of OSH1 and OsSCR, which mark the presumptive apical region and the L2 layer, respectively, are identical to those in WT, suggesting a possibility either that different IAA levels are required for basic pattern formation than for organ formation or that an orthologous gene compensates for TDD1 deficiency during pattern formation
OsSCR|OsSCR2	stomata	The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants	In leaf primordia, expression of OsSCR was observed in stomatal and ligule formation
OsSCR|OsSCR2	stomata	The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants	In stomatal development, OsSCR was specifically expressed in the stomatal cell files before formation of guard mother cells (GMCs), and then, its expression was localized in GMCs, when the first asymmetric division occurred to generate the GMCs
OsSCR|OsSCR2	stomata	The SCARECROW gene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants	Based on these observations, we proposed that OsSCR is involved not only in the asymmetric division of the cortex/endodermis progenitor cell but also during stomata and ligule formation by establishing the polarization of cytoplasm
