OsSLRL2	SLR1|OsGAI	Overexpression of a GRAS protein lacking the DELLA domain confers altered gibberellin responses in rice	SLRL1 and SLRL2 contain regions with high similarity to the C-terminal conserved domains in SLR1, but lack the N-terminal conserved region of the DELLA proteins
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsSLRL2	Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.	Analysis of protein-protein interactions showed that OsJAZ8 and OsJAZ9 interact with SLR1; OsJAZ9 also interacted with the SLR1-LIKE (SLRL) protein SLRL2.
