OsSPX3	OsSPX5	The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice	In this study, phylogenetic analysis revealed that OsSPX3 and OsSPX5 (SPX3/5) are paralogous SPX genes ( SYG1/Pho81/XPR1) in cereal crops
OsSPX3	OsSPX5	The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice	Similar tissue expression patterns of the two genes and proteins were identified by in situ hybridization and the transgenic plants harbouring SPX3pro-SPX3-GUS or SPX5pro-SPX5-GUS fusions, respectively
OsSPX3	OsSPX5	The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice	The paralogous SPX3 and SPX5 genes redundantly modulate Pi homeostasis in rice
OsSPX1	OsSPX3	Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice	The subcellular localization analysis indicates that OsSPX1 and OsSPX2 is exclusively located in nucleus, OsSPX3 in the cytoplasm, and OsSPX4 is a membrane localization protein
OsSPX1	OsSPX3	Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice	Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice
LTN1|OsPHO2|OsRLS1	OsSPX3	Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice	OsSPX3 negatively regulates the PSI (Pi-starvation induced) gene, OsIPS1 and is involved in the responses of miR399 and OsPHO2 to Pi-starvation
LTN1|OsPHO2|OsRLS1	OsSPX3	Regulation of OsSPX1 and OsSPX3 on expression of OsSPX domain genes and Pi-starvation signaling in rice	OsSPX3 plays a role in OsIPS1/miR399 mediated long distance regulation on OsPHO2
