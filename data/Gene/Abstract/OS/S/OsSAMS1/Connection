Hd3a	OsSAMS1	Knockdown of SAMS genes encoding S-adenosyl-l-methionine synthetases causes methylation alterations of DNAs and histones and leads to late flowering in rice	Knockdown of OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 led to distinguished late flowering and greatly reduced the expression of the flowering key genes, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Hd3a and RFT1 (rice FT-like genes)
Ehd1	OsSAMS1	Knockdown of SAMS genes encoding S-adenosyl-l-methionine synthetases causes methylation alterations of DNAs and histones and leads to late flowering in rice	Knockdown of OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 led to distinguished late flowering and greatly reduced the expression of the flowering key genes, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Hd3a and RFT1 (rice FT-like genes)
OsSAMS1	OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a|RFT1	Knockdown of SAMS genes encoding S-adenosyl-l-methionine synthetases causes methylation alterations of DNAs and histones and leads to late flowering in rice	Knockdown of OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 led to distinguished late flowering and greatly reduced the expression of the flowering key genes, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Hd3a and RFT1 (rice FT-like genes)
OsFBK12	OsSAMS1	The F-box protein OsFBK12 targets OsSAMS1 for degradation and affects pleiotropic phenotypes, including leaf senescence, in rice	Here, we report that OsFBK12 (an F-box protein containing a Kelch repeat motif) interacts with S-ADENOSYL-l-METHIONINE SYNTHETASE1 (SAMS1) to regulate leaf senescence and seed size as well as grain number in rice (Oryza sativa)
OsFBK12	OsSAMS1	The F-box protein OsFBK12 targets OsSAMS1 for degradation and affects pleiotropic phenotypes, including leaf senescence, in rice	Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays indicate that OsFBK12 interacts with Oryza sativa S-PHASE KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN1-LIKE PROTEIN and with OsSAMS1
OsFBK12	OsSAMS1	The F-box protein OsFBK12 targets OsSAMS1 for degradation and affects pleiotropic phenotypes, including leaf senescence, in rice	Biochemical and physiological data showed that OsFBK12 targets OsSAMS1 for degradation
OsFBK12	OsSAMS1	The F-box protein OsFBK12 targets OsSAMS1 for degradation and affects pleiotropic phenotypes, including leaf senescence, in rice	OsFBK12-RNA interference lines and OsSAMS1 overexpression lines showed increased ethylene levels, while OsFBK12-OX lines and OsSAMS1-RNA interference plants exhibited decreased ethylene
OsFBK12	OsSAMS1	The F-box protein OsFBK12 targets OsSAMS1 for degradation and affects pleiotropic phenotypes, including leaf senescence, in rice	Phenotypically, overexpression of OsFBK12 led to a delay in leaf senescence and germination and increased seed size, whereas knockdown lines of either OsFBK12 or OsSAMS1 promoted the senescence program
OsFBK12	OsSAMS1	The F-box protein OsFBK12 targets OsSAMS1 for degradation and affects pleiotropic phenotypes, including leaf senescence, in rice	Our results suggest that OsFBK12 is involved in the 26S proteasome pathway by interacting with Oryza sativa S-PHASE KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN1-LIKE PROTEIN and that it targets the substrate OsSAMS1 for degradation, triggering changes in ethylene levels for the regulation of leaf senescence and grain size
OsFBK12	OsSAMS1	The F-box protein OsFBK12 targets OsSAMS1 for degradation and affects pleiotropic phenotypes, including leaf senescence, in rice	The F-box protein OsFBK12 targets OsSAMS1 for degradation and affects pleiotropic phenotypes, including leaf senescence, in rice
