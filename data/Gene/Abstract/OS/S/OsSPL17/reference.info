Rice (Oryza sativa L.) microRNA156/529-SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE7/14/17 (miR156/529-SPL7/14/17) modules have pleiotropic effects on many biological pathways. OsSPL7/14 can interact with DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) to modulate gibberellin acid (GA) signal transduction against the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. However, whether the miR156/529-OsSPL7/14/17 modules also regulate resistance against other pathogens is unclear. Notably, OsSPL7/14/17 functioning as transcriptional activators, their target genes, and the corresponding downstream signaling pathways remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that miR156/529 play negative roles in plant immunity and that miR156/529-regulated OsSPL7/14/17 confer broad-spectrum resistance against two devastating bacterial pathogens. Three OsSPL7/14/17 proteins directly bind to the promoters of rice Allene Oxide Synthases 2 (OsAOS2) and NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1 (OsNPR1) and activate their transcription, regulating jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation and the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway, respectively. Overexpression of OsAOS2 or OsNPR1 impairs the susceptibility of the osspl7/14/17 triple mutant. Exogenous application of JA enhances resistance of the osspl7/14/17 triple mutant and the miR156 overexpressing plants. In addition, genetic evidence confirms that bacterial pathogen-activated miR156/529 negatively regulate pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) responses, such as pattern recognition receptor Xa3/Xa26-initiated PTI. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial pathogens modulate miR156/529-OsSPL7/14/17 modules to suppress OsAOS2-catalyzed JA accumulation and the OsNPR1-promoted SA signaling pathway, facilitating pathogen infection. The uncovered miR156/529-OsSPL7/14/17-OsAOS2/OsNPR1 regulatory network provides a potential strategy to genetically improve rice disease resistance.
