OsSPY	SLR1|OsGAI	The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis	The suppression of OsSPY function in a GA-insensitive mutant, gid2, also caused an increase in the phosphorylation of a rice DELLA protein, SLR1, but did not change the amount of SLR1
OsSPY	SLR1|OsGAI	The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis	This indicates that the function of OsSPY in GA signaling is not via changes in the amount or stability of SLR1, but probably involves control of the suppressive function of SLR1
OsSPY	sd1|GA20ox2	The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis	The suppressive function of OsSPY in GA signaling was supported by the findings that the dwarfism was partially rescued and OsGA20ox2 (GA20 oxidase) expression was reduced in GA-deficient and GA-insensitive mutants by the knockdown of OsSPY function
OsSPY	SLR1|OsGAI	GWAS with principal component analysis identifies a gene comprehensively controlling rice architecture.	 A genome-wide association study (GWAS) using PC1 as a dependent variable was used to isolate a gene encoding rice, SPINDLY (OsSPY), that activates the gibberellin (GA) signal suppression protein SLR1
