NA	OsSWEET11b, a potential sixth leaf blight susceptibility gene involved in sugar transport-dependent male fertility.	2022	New Phytol	Institute for Molecular Physiology, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, 40225, Germany.	SWEETs play important roles in intercellular sugar transport. Induction of SWEET sugar transporters by Transcription Activator-Like effectors (TALe) of Xanthomonas ssp. is key for virulence in rice, cassava and cotton. We identified OsSWEET11b with roles in male fertility and potential bacterial blight (BB) susceptibility in rice. While single ossweet11a or 11b mutants were fertile, double mutants were sterile. As clade III SWEETs can transport gibberellin (GA), a key hormone for spikelet fertility, sterility and BB susceptibility might be explained by GA transport deficiencies. However, in contrast with the Arabidopsis homologues, OsSWEET11b did not mediate detectable GA transport. Fertility and susceptibility therefore are likely to depend on sucrose transport activity. Ectopic induction of OsSWEET11b by designer TALe enabled TALe-free Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) to cause disease, identifying OsSWEET11b as a potential BB susceptibility gene and demonstrating that the induction of host sucrose uniporter activity is key to virulence of Xoo. Notably, only three of six clade III SWEETs are targeted by known Xoo strains from Asia and Africa. The identification of OsSWEET11b is relevant for fertility and for protecting rice against emerging Xoo strains that target OsSWEET11b.
