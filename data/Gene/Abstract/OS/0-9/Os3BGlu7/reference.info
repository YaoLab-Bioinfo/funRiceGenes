Plant beta-D-mannosidases and a rice beta-D-glucosidase, Os3BGlu7, with weak beta-D-mannosidase activity, cluster together in phylogenetic analysis. To investigate the relationship between substrate specificity and amino acid sequence similarity in family GH1 glycoside hydrolases, Os3BGlu8 and Os7BGlu26, putative rice beta-D-glucosidases from this cluster, and a beta-D-mannosidase from barley (rHvBII), were expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. Os3BGlu8, the amino acid sequence and molecular model of which are most similar to Os3BGlu7, hydrolysed 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4NPGlc) faster than 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-mannopyranoside (4NPMan), while Os7BGlu26, which is most similar to rHvBII by these criteria, hydrolysed 4NPMan faster than 4NPGlc. All the enzymes hydrolyzed cellooligosaccharides with increased hydrolytic rates as the degree of polymerization increased from 3-6, but only rHvBII hydrolyzed cellobiose with a higher k(cat)/K(m) value than cellotriose. This was primarily due to strong binding of glucosyl residues at the+2 subsite for the rice enzymes, and unfavorable interactions at this subsite with rHvBII.
Plant Physiol.-2009-Seshadri-47-58.pdf	Structural and enzymatic characterization of Os3BGlu6, a rice beta-glucosidase hydrolyzing hydrophobic glycosides and (1->3)- and (1->2)-linked disaccharides	2009	Plant Physiol	School of Biochemistry, Institute of Science, Suranaree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand.	Glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1) beta-glucosidases play roles in many processes in plants, such as chemical defense, alkaloid metabolism, hydrolysis of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides, phytohormone regulation, and lignification. However, the functions of most of the 34 GH1 gene products in rice (Oryza sativa) are unknown. Os3BGlu6, a rice beta-glucosidase representing a previously uncharacterized phylogenetic cluster of GH1, was produced in recombinant Escherichia coli. Os3BGlu6 hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl (pNP)-beta-d-fucoside (k(cat)/K(m) = 67 mm(-1) s(-1)), pNP-beta-d-glucoside (k(cat)/K(m) = 6.2 mm(-1) s(-1)), and pNP-beta-d-galactoside (k(cat)/K(m) = 1.6 mm(-1)s(-1)) efficiently but had little activity toward other pNP glycosides. It also had high activity toward n-octyl-beta-d-glucoside and beta-(1-->3)- and beta-(1-->2)-linked disaccharides and was able to hydrolyze apigenin beta-glucoside and several other natural glycosides. Crystal structures of Os3BGlu6 and its complexes with a covalent intermediate, 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucoside, and a nonhydrolyzable substrate analog, n-octyl-beta-d-thioglucopyranoside, were solved at 1.83, 1.81, and 1.80 A resolution, respectively. The position of the covalently trapped 2-F-glucosyl residue in the enzyme was similar to that in a 2-F-glucosyl intermediate complex of Os3BGlu7 (rice BGlu1). The side chain of methionine-251 in the mouth of the active site appeared to block the binding of extended beta-(1-->4)-linked oligosaccharides and interact with the hydrophobic aglycone of n-octyl-beta-d-thioglucopyranoside. This correlates with the preference of Os3BGlu6 for short oligosaccharides and hydrophobic glycosides.
NA	Structural Basis of Specific Glucoimidazole and Mannoimidazole Binding by Os3BGlu7	2020	Biomolecules .	Center of Excellence in Computational Chemistry (CECC), Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.	¦Â-Glucosidases and ¦Â-mannosidases hydrolyze substrates that differ only in the epimer of the nonreducing terminal sugar moiety, but most such enzymes show a strong preference for one activity or the other. Rice Os3BGlu7 and Os7BGlu26 ¦Â-glycosidases show a less strong preference, but Os3BGlu7 and Os7BGlu26 prefer glucosides and mannosides, respectively. Previous studies of crystal structures with glucoimidazole (GIm) and mannoimidazole (MIm) complexes and metadynamic simulations suggested that Os7BGlu26 hydrolyzes mannosides via the B2,5 transition state (TS) conformation preferred for mannosides and glucosides via their preferred 4H3/4E TS conformation. However, MIm is weakly bound by both enzymes. In the present study, we found that MIm was not bound in the active site of crystallized Os3BGlu7, but GIm was tightly bound in the -1 subsite in a 4H3/4E conformation via hydrogen bonds with the surrounding residues. One-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations showed that GIm was stably bound in the Os3BGlu7 active site and the glycone-binding site with little distortion. In contrast, MIm initialized in the B2,5 conformation rapidly relaxed to a E3/4H3 conformation and moved out into a position in the entrance of the active site, where it bound more stably despite making fewer interactions. The lack of MIm binding in the glycone site in protein crystals and simulations implies that the energy required to distort MIm to the B2,5 conformation for optimal active site residue interactions is sufficient to offset the energy of those interactions in Os3BGlu7. This balance between distortion and binding energy may also provide a rationale for glucosidase versus mannosidase specificity in plant ¦Â-glycosidases.
