Os12BGlu38	pollen	Rice β-Glucosidase Os12BGlu38 is Required for Synthesis of Intine Cell Wall and Pollen Fertility.	Rice β-Glucosidase Os12BGlu38 is Required for Synthesis of Intine Cell Wall and Pollen Fertility.
Os12BGlu38	pollen	Rice β-Glucosidase Os12BGlu38 is Required for Synthesis of Intine Cell Wall and Pollen Fertility.	 Histochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy showed that mutant pollen lacked intine cell wall, which was rescued by introduction of WT Os12BGlu38 genomic DNA
Os12BGlu38	cell wall	Rice β-Glucosidase Os12BGlu38 is Required for Synthesis of Intine Cell Wall and Pollen Fertility.	Rice β-Glucosidase Os12BGlu38 is Required for Synthesis of Intine Cell Wall and Pollen Fertility.
