OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	OsMADS16|SPW1	Morphogenesis and molecular basis on naked seed rice, a novel homeotic mutation of OsMADS1 regulating transcript level of AP3 homologue in rice	Moreover, it was indicated that OsMADS1 upregulated the transcript level of AP3 homologue OsMADS16, using real-time PCR analysis on gain- and loss-of-function of OsMADS1 transgenic lines
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsMADS4	Functional analysis of the rice AP3 homologue OsMADS16 by RNA interference	Our results demonstrate that OsMADS16 is an AP3/DEF orthologue to specify the identities of lodicules and stamens in rice flower and also support that OsMADS4 is a PI orthologue
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsMADS6|MFO1|AFG1	Alteration of floral organ identity in rice through ectopic expression of OsMADS16	OsMADS16 also interacted with OsMADS6 and OSMADS8, both of which are homologous to SEPALLATA proteins required for the proper function of class-B and class-C genes in Arabidopsis
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsMADS4	Alteration of floral organ identity in rice through ectopic expression of OsMADS16	In addition, ectopic expression of OsMADS16 enhanced expression of OsMADS4, another B-function gene, causing superman phenotypes
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsMADS4	Alteration of floral organ identity in rice through ectopic expression of OsMADS16	In the yeast two-hybrid system, OsMADS16 did not form a homodimer but, rather, the protein interacted with OsMADS4
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsMADS8|OsMADS24	Alteration of floral organ identity in rice through ectopic expression of OsMADS16	OsMADS16 also interacted with OsMADS6 and OSMADS8, both of which are homologous to SEPALLATA proteins required for the proper function of class-B and class-C genes in Arabidopsis
DL	OsMADS16|SPW1	SUPERWOMAN1 and DROOPING LEAF genes control floral organ identity in rice	We analyzed recessive mutants of two homeotic genes in rice, SUPERWOMAN1 (SPW1) and DROOPING LEAF (DL)
DL	OsMADS16|SPW1	SUPERWOMAN1 and DROOPING LEAF genes control floral organ identity in rice	The flower of the double mutant, spw1 dl-sup, produces incompletely differentiated organs indefinitely after palea-like organs are produced in the position where lodicules are formed in the wild-type flower
DL	OsMADS16|SPW1	SUPERWOMAN1 and DROOPING LEAF genes control floral organ identity in rice	Based on genetic and molecular results, we postulate a model of stamen and carpel specification in rice, with DL as a novel gene controlling carpel identity and acting mutually and antagonistically to the class B gene, SPW1
OsMADS16|SPW1	SL1|OsJAG	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	We also show that SL1 specifies lodicule and stamen identities through positive transcriptional regulation of SPW1/OsMADS16 expression
OsMADS16|SPW1	SL1|OsJAG	STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	The sl1 mutant largely resembles the rice B-class gene mutant spw1; both exhibit homeotic conversions of lodicules and stamens to palea/lemma-like organs and carpels
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsMADS6|MFO1|AFG1	Rice MADS6 interacts with the floral homeotic genes SUPERWOMAN1, MADS3, MADS58, MADS13, and DROOPING LEAF in specifying floral organ identities and meristem fate	Genetic analyses revealed that MADS6 specifies the identity of the three inner whorls and floral meristem determinacy redundantly with SUPERWOMAN1/MADS16 (B-gene) or MADS3 (C-gene)
DDF1	OsMADS16|SPW1	Dwarf and deformed flower 1, encoding an F-box protein, is critical for vegetative and floral development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Consistent with the mutant floral phenotype, DDF1 positively regulates B-class genes OsMADS4 and OsMADS16, and negatively regulates pistil specification gene DL
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsMADS4	Dwarf and deformed flower 1, encoding an F-box protein, is critical for vegetative and floral development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Consistent with the mutant floral phenotype, DDF1 positively regulates B-class genes OsMADS4 and OsMADS16, and negatively regulates pistil specification gene DL
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsMADS2	The superwoman1-cleistogamy2 mutant is a novel resource for gene containment in rice.	Lodicule identity and development are specified by the action of protein complexes involving the SPW1 and OsMADS2 transcription factors
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsMADS2	The superwoman1-cleistogamy2 mutant is a novel resource for gene containment in rice.	In the superwoman1-cleistogamy1 (spw1-cls1) mutant, SPW1 is impaired for heterodimerization with OsMADS2 and consequently spw1-cls1 shows thin, ineffective lodicules
NSG|NSG1	OsMADS16|SPW1	nonstop glumes (nsg), a novel mutant affects spikelet development in rice	 The expression of OsMADS4, OsMADS16, DL and OsMADS3 decreased distinctly, and OsMADS1 increased in nsg panicle, suggests that NSG affected spikelet development through influencing the expression of floral hometic genes
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsPID|OsPINOID	PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.	 Additionally, OsPID also interacts with OsMADS16 to regulate transcription during floral organ development in rice
OsMADS16|SPW1	OsPID|OsPINOID	PINOID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin transport and interacts with MADS16 in rice.	 Together, we propose a model that OsPID regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin polar transport and interaction with OsMADS16 and/or LAX1 in rice
