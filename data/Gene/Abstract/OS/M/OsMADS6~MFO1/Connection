OsIG1	OsMADS6|MFO1	Down-regulation of a LBD-like gene, OsIG1, leads to occurrence of unusual double ovules and developmental abnormalities of various floral organs and megagametophyte in rice	Additionally, down-regulation of OsIG1 differentially affected the expression of genes associated with the floral organ development including EG1, OsMADS6 and OsMADS1.
OsEMF2b	OsMADS6|MFO1	The polycomb group gene EMF2B is essential for maintenance of floral meristem determinacy in rice	Transcriptome analysis identified the E-function genes OsMADS1, OsMADS6 and OsMADS34 as differentially expressed in the emf2b mutant compared with wild type.
