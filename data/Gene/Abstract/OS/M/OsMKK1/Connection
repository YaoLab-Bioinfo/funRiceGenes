MYBS3|OsMYBS3	OsMKK1	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	By comparing the transcription factors levels between WT and osmkk1 mutant, OsMKK1 was necessary for salt-induced increase in OsDREB2B and OsMYBS3
OsDREB2B	OsMKK1	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	By comparing the transcription factors levels between WT and osmkk1 mutant, OsMKK1 was necessary for salt-induced increase in OsDREB2B and OsMYBS3
OsMKK1	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro and in vivo kinase assays revealed that OsMKK1 targeted OsMPK4
OsMKK1	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	OsMPK4 activity was increased by salt, which was impaired in osmkk1 plants
OsMKK1	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	In contrast, overexpression of OsMKK1 increased OsMPK4 activity in protoplasts
OsMKK1	OsMPK6|OsMPK4	The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.	Taken together, the data suggest that OsMKK1 and OsMPK4 constitute a signaling pathway that regulates salt stress tolerance in rice
OsMAPKKK63	OsMKK1	OsMAPKKK63 is involved in salt stress response and seed dormancy control.	 Our data indicate that OsMAPKKK63 possesses in vitro kinase activity and that it interacts with rice MAP kinase kinase OsMKK1 and OsMKK6
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMKK1	Rice calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase directly phosphorylates a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase to regulate abscisic acid responses	 Here, we show that OsDMI3, a rice (Oryza sativa) CCaMK, directly interacts with and phosphorylates OsMKK1, a MAPK kinase (MKK) in rice, in vitro and in vivo
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMKK1	Rice calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase directly phosphorylates a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase to regulate abscisic acid responses	 OsDMI3 was found to directly phosphorylate Thr-25 in the N-terminus of OsMKK1, and this Thr-25 phosphorylation is OsDMI3-specific in ABA signaling
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	OsMKK1	Rice calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase directly phosphorylates a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase to regulate abscisic acid responses	 Our results indicate that OsMKK1 is a direct target of OsDMI3, and OsDMI3-mediated phosphorylation of OsMKK1 plays an important role in activating the MAPK cascade and ABA signaling
OsMKK1	OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	Rice calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase directly phosphorylates a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase to regulate abscisic acid responses	 The activation of OsMKK1 and its downstream kinase OsMPK1 is dependent on Thr-25 phosphorylation of OsMKK1 in ABA signaling
