Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play important roles in diverse developmental and physiological processes of plants, including pathogen-induced defense responses. Although at least 17 rice MAPKs have been identified and more than half of these MAPK genes have been shown to be pathogen or elicitor responsive, the exact role of most of the MAPKs in host-pathogen interaction is unknown. Here we report that OsMPK6 is an important regulator in rice disease resistance. Suppressing OsMPK6 or knocking out of OsMPK6 enhanced rice resistance to different races of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, causing bacterial blight, one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. The resistant plants showed increased expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes functioning in the NH1 (an Arabidopsis NPR1 orthologue)-involved defense signal transduction pathway. These results suggest that OsMPK6 functions as a repressor to regulate rice defense responses upon bacterial invasion.
10.1007-s11103-012-9941-y.pdf	OsWRKY30 is activated by MAP kinases to confer drought tolerance in rice	2012	Plant Mol Biol	Key Laboratory of Freshwater Fisheries and Germplasm Resources Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture, Freshwater Fisheries Research Center, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Wuxi 214081, People's Republic of China.	Both the WRKY transcription factor (TF) and MAP kinases have been shown to regulate gene expression in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Several reports have shown that WRKY TFs may function downstream of MAPK cascades. Here, we have shown that OsWRKY30 interacted with OsMPK3, OsMPK4, OsMPK7, OsMPK14, OsMPK20-4, and OsMPK20-5, and could be phosphorylated by OsMPK3, OsMPK7, and OsMPK14. Overexpression of OsWRKY30 in rice dramatically increased drought tolerance. Overexpression of OsWRKY30AA, in which all SP (serine residue followed by proline residue) sites were replaced by AP (A, alanine), resulted in no improvement in drought tolerance. In addition, the function of transcriptional activation of OsWRKY30 was impaired after SP was replaced by AP. These results proved that the phosphorylation of OsWRKY30 by MAPKs was crucial in order for OsWRKY30 to perform its biological function.
4430095.pdf	Biochemical identification of the OsMKK6-OsMPK3 signalling pathway for chilling stress tolerance in rice	2012	Biochem J	Crop Breeding Research Division, Hokkaido Agricultural Research Center, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Hitsujigaoka 1, Toyohira-ku, Sapporo 062-8555, Japan.	MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways have been implicated in stress signalling in plants. In the present study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify partner MAPKs for OsMKK (Oryza sativa MAPK kinase) 6, a rice MAPK kinase, and revealed specific interactions of OsMKK6 with OsMPK3 and OsMPK6. OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 each co-immunoprecipitated OsMKK6, and both were directly phosphorylated by OsMKK6 in vitro. An MBP (myelin basic protein) kinase assay of the immunoprecipitation complex indicated that OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 were activated in response to a moderately low temperature (12 degrees C), but not a severely low temperature (4 degrees C) in rice seedlings. A constitutively active form of OsMKK6, OsMKK6DD, showed elevated phosphorylation activity against OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro. OsMPK3, but not OsMPK6, was constitutively activated in transgenic plants overexpressing OsMKK6DD, indicating that OsMPK3 is an in vivo target of OsMKK6. Enhanced chilling tolerance was observed in the transgenic plants overexpressing OsMKK6DD. Taken together, our data suggest that OsMKK6 and OsMPK3 constitute a moderately low-temperature signalling pathway and regulate cold stress tolerance in rice.
j.1365-313X.2010.04306.x.pdf	Opposite functions of a rice mitogen-activated protein kinase during the process of resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae	2010	Plant J	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The pathogen-induced plant defense signaling network consists of multiple components, although only some of them are characterized. Most of the known components function either as activators or repressors in host-pathogen interactions. Here we report that a mitogen-activated protein kinase, OsMPK6, functions both as an activator and a repressor in rice resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal organism of bacterial blight disease. Activation of OsMPK6 resulted in the formation of lesion mimics and local resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), and the induced expression of SA- and JA-signaling genes. Nuclear localization of OsMPK6 was essential for local resistance, suggesting that modulating the expression of defense-responsive genes through transcription regulators may be the primary mechanism of OsMPK6-mediated local resistance. The knock-out of OsMPK6 resulted in enhanced Xoo resistance, increased accumulation of SA and enhanced resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzicola, the causal organism of bacterial streak disease, in systemic tissues. Xoo infection induced the expression of PR1a, the marker gene of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), in systemic health tissues of OsMPK6-knock-out plants. These results suggest that OsMPK6 negatively regulates SAR. Thus OsMPK6 is a two-faced player in the rice-Xoo interaction.
MPMI-19-0530.pdf	Molecular analysis of the rice MAP kinase gene family in relation to Magnaporthe grisea infection	2006	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Department of Plant Pathology, Program in Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, USA.	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a crucial role in plant growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses. In Arabidopsis, 20 MAPKs have been identified and divided into four major groups. In rice, a monocot model and economically important cereal crop, only five MAPKs were characterized, including three related to the host defense response. In this study, we have identified 17 members of the rice MAPK gene (OsMPK) family through an in silico search of rice genome databases. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of Arabidopsis and rice MAPKs, we propose that MAPKs can be divided into six groups. Interestingly, the rice genome contains many more MAPKs with the TDY phosphorylation site (11 members) than with the TEY motif (six members). In contrast, the Arabidopsis genome contains more MAPKs with the TEY motif (12 members) than with the TDY motif (eight members). Upon inoculation with the blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), nine of 17 OsMPK genes were found to be induced at the mRNA level during either early, late, or both stages of infection. Four of the M. grisea-induced OsMPK genes were associated with host-cell death in the lesion-mimic rice mutant, and eight of them were differentially induced in response to defense signal molecules such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and ethylene. The genome-wide expression analysis suggests that about half of the rice MAPK genes are associated with pathogen infection and host defense response.
Plant Cell Physiol-2007-Katou-332-44.pdf	A calmodulin-binding mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase is induced by wounding and regulates the activities of stress-related mitogen-activated protein kinases in rice	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases (MKPs) are negative regulators of MAPKs. In dicotyledons such as Arabidopsis and tobacco, MKPs have been shown to play pivotal roles in abiotic stress responses, hormone responses and microtubule organization. However, little is known about the role of MKPs in monocotyledons such as rice. Database searches identified five putative MKPs in rice. We investigated their expression in response to wounding, and found that the expression of OsMKP1 is rapidly induced by wounding. In this study, we functionally characterized the involvement of OsMKP1 in wound responses. The deduced amino acid sequence of OsMKP1 shows strong similarity to Arabidopsis AtMKP1 and tobacco NtMKP1. Moreover, OsMKP1 bound calmodulin in a manner similar to NtMKP1. To determine the biological function of OsMKP1, we obtained osmkp1, a loss-of-function mutant, in which retrotransposon Tos17 was inserted in the second exon of OsMKP1. Unlike the Arabidopsis atmkp1 loss-of-function mutant, which shows no abnormal phenotype without stimuli, osmkp1 showed a semi-dwarf phenotype. Exogenous supply of neither gibberellin nor brassinosteroid complemented the semi-dwarf phenotype of osmkp1. Activities of two stress-responsive MAPKs, OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, in osmkp1 were higher than those in the wild type both before and after wounding. Microarray analysis identified 13 up-regulated and eight down-regulated genes in osmkp1. Among the up-regulated genes, the expression of five genes showed clear responses to wounding, indicating that wound responses are constitutively activated in osmkp1. These results suggest that OsMKP1 is involved in the negative regulation of rice wound responses.
Xie-2009-A cold-induced thior.pdf	A cold-induced thioredoxin h of rice, OsTrx23, negatively regulates kinase activities of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro	2009	FEBS Lett	National Agricultural Research Center for Hokkaido Region, National Agricultural and Food Research Organization, Sapporo, Japan.	Cytosolic thioredoxins are small conserved proteins that are involved in cellular redox regulation. Here, we report that a major and cold-induced thioredoxin h of rice, OsTrx23, has an inhibitory activity on stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro. This inhibition effects were redox-dependent and did not involve stable physical interaction. The data suggested a novel mechanism for redox regulation of MAPKs in plants.
NA	A redox-sensitive cysteine residue regulates the kinase activities of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 in vitro.	2014	Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, PR China. Electronic address: xiegsh@mail.hzau.edu.cn.	Two subgroup A rice mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, have been implicated in multiple stress responses. However, the redox-control of the kinase activity of these proteins remains unknown. Here, immunoprecipitated OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 were initially activated in 15min, and this activation transiently increased in rice seedlings under H2O2 stress. Among the six conserved cysteine residues, only the fourth cysteine residues in the kinase domain VII, Cys(179) and Cys(210), were required for the in vitro kinase activities of OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, respectively. Moreover, the substitution of these specific cysteine residues with serine abrogated in vitro kinase responses to redox conditions. These results suggest a novel redox-control mechanism for the kinase activities of these MAPKs in vivo.
NA	Abiotic Stresses Antagonize the Rice Defence Pathway through the Tyrosine-Dephosphorylation of OsMPK6.	2015	PLoS Pathog	Disease Resistant Crops Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Plants, as sessile organisms, survive environmental changes by prioritizing their responses to the most life-threatening stress by allocating limited resources. Previous studies showed that pathogen resistance was suppressed under abiotic stresses. Here, we show the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Phosphorylation of WRKY45, the central transcription factor in salicylic-acid (SA)-signalling-dependent pathogen defence in rice, via the OsMKK10-2-OsMPK6 cascade, was required to fully activate WRKY45. The activation of WRKY45 by benzothiadiazole (BTH) was reduced under low temperature and high salinity, probably through abscisic acid (ABA) signalling. An ABA treatment dephosphorylated/inactivated OsMPK6 via protein tyrosine phosphatases, OsPTP1/2, leading to the impaired activation of WRKY45 and a reduction in Magnaporthe oryzae resistance, even after BTH treatment. BTH induced a strong M. oryzae resistance in OsPTP1/2 knockdown rice, even under cold and high salinity, indicating that OsPTP1/2 is the node of SA-ABA signalling crosstalk and its down-regulation makes rice disease resistant, even under abiotic stresses. These results points to one of the directions to further improve crops by managing the tradeoffs between different stress responses of plants.
NA	OsMPK6 plays a critical role in cell differentiation during early embryogenesis in Oryza sativa.	2016	J Exp Bot	Crop Biotech Institute and Graduate School of Biotechnology, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, 446-701, Republic of Korea.	The formation of body axes is the basis of morphogenesis during plant embryogenesis. We identified embryo-lethal mutants of rice (Oryza sativa) in which T-DNAs were inserted inOsMPK6 Embryonic organs were absent because their development was arrested at the globular stage. Similar to observations made withgle4,shootless, andorganless, theosmpk6mutations affected the initial step of cell differentiation. Expression of an apical-basal axis marker gene,OSH1, was reduced in the mutant embryos while that of the radial axes marker genesOsSCRandOsPNH1was not detected. The signal forROC1, a protodermal cell marker, was weak at the globular stage and gradually disappeared. Transcript levels of auxin and gibberellin biosynthesis genes were diminished inosmpk6embryos. In addition, phytoalexin biosynthesis genes were down-regulated inosmpk6and a major diterpene phytoalexin, momilactone A, did not accumulate in the mutant embryos. These results indicate thatOsMPK6begins to play a critical role during early embryogenesis, especially when the L1 radial axis is being formed.
NA	Discovery of rice essential genes by characterizing CRISPR-edited mutation of closely related rice MAP kinase genes.	2016	Plant J	Intercollege Graduate Degree Program in Plant Biology, The Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 nuclease (Cas9) system depends on a guide RNA (gRNA) to specify its target. By efficiently co-expressing multiple gRNAs that target different genomic sites, the polycistronic tRNA-gRNA gene (PTG) strategy enables multiplex gene editing in the family of closely related rice mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) genes. In this study, we identified MPK1 and MPK6 (Arabidopsis AtMPK6 and AtMPK4 orthologues, respectively) as essential genes for rice development by finding the preservation of MPK functional alleles and normal phenotypes in CRISPR-edited mutants. The true knock-out mutants of MPK1 were severely dwarfed and sterile, and homozygous mpk1 seeds from heterozygous parents were defective in embryo development. By contrast, heterozygous mpk6 mutant plants completely failed to produce homozygous mpk6 seeds. In addition, functional importance of specific MPK features could be evaluated by characterizing CRISPR-induced allelic variation in the conserved kinase domain of MPK6. By simultaneously targeting two to eight genomic sites in the closely related MPK genes, we demonstrated 45 to 86% frequency of biallelic mutations and successful creation of single, double and quadruple gene mutants. Indels and fragment deletion were both stably inherited to the next generations and transgene-free mutants of rice MPK genes were readily obtained via genetic segregation, thereby eliminating any positional effects of transgene insertions. Taken together, our study reveals essentiality of MPK1 and MPK6 in rice development and enables functional discovery of the previously inaccessible genes or domains because their phenotypes are masked by lethality or redundancy.

NA	WRKY45 phosphorylation at threonine 266 acts negatively on WRKY45-dependent blast resistance in rice.	2017	Plant Signal Behav	a Disease Resistant Crops Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences , Tsukuba , Ibaraki 305-8602 , Japan.	WRKY45 is a central regulator of disease resistance mediated by salicylic acid signaling in rice and its activation involves phosphorylation by OsMPK6. OsMPK6 phosphorylates WRKY45 at Thr266, Ser294, and Ser299 in vitro. Phosphorylation of Ser294 and/or Ser299 is required for full activation of WRKY45, but the importance of Thr266 phosphorylation has remained unknown. Here, we report on the characterization of Thr266 phosphorylation of WRKY45 in rice. Transient expression of mutant WRKY45 revealed that Thr266 is phosphorylated in vivo, together with Ser294/299. Replacement of Thr266 by Asn did not affect the enhanced Magnaporthe oryzae resistance afforded by WRKY45 overexpression. By contrast, replacement by Asp negated the enhancement of M. oryzae resistance. These results suggest that Thr266 phosphorylation acts negatively on WRKY45-dependent disease resistance.
NA	Expressing OsMPK4 Impairs Plant Growth but Enhances the Resistance of Rice to the Striped Stem Borer Chilo suppressalis.	2018	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology &amp; Ministry of Agriculture Key Lab of Agricultural Entomology, Institute of Insect Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China. 21216107@zju.edu.cn.	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) play a central role not only in plant growth and development, but also in plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses, including pathogens. Yet, their role in herbivore-induced plant defenses and their underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we cloned a rice MPK gene, OsMPK4, whose expression was induced by mechanical wounding, infestation of the striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis, and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA), but not by treatment with salicylic acid (SA). The overexpression of OsMPK4 (oe-MPK4) enhanced constitutive and/or SSB-induced levels of JA, jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile), ethylene (ET), and SA, as well as the activity of elicited trypsin proteinase inhibitors (TrypPIs), and reduced SSB performance. On the other hand, compared to wild-type plants, oe-MPK4 lines in the greenhouse showed growth retardation. These findings suggest that OsMPK4, by regulating JA-, ET-, and SA-mediated signaling pathways, functions as a positive regulator of rice resistance to the SSB and a negative regulator of rice growth.
