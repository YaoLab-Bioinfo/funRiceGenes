OSMADS58	A gene expression profiling of early rice stamen development that reveals inhibition of photosynthetic genesby OsMADS58. |  Following the finding of systematic low expression of nuclear genes encoding photosynthetic proteins in early rice stamen, we found that a C-class MADS box protein OsMADS58 can bind many nuclear coded photosystem and other light reaction genes based on ChIP-seq analysis |  When the expression level of OsMADS58 is downregulated, e |  in osmads58 mutant, the expression levels of OsMADS58 target genes increase, more prochloroplasts are observed, and more ROS signal is detected in the mutant anthers
OSMADS58	 This CRISPR mutant line exhibited stronger changes in expression of OsMADS58 target genes compared with the osmads58 dSpm (transposon insertion) line, along with changes in multiple pathways related to early stamen development
