gni003.pdf	A simple method for predicting the functional differentiation of duplicate genes and its application to MIKC-type MADS-box genes	2005	Nucleic Acids Res	Institute of Molecular Evolutionary Genetics and Department of Biology, Pennsylvania State University University Park, PA 16802, USA. JYN101@PSU.EDU	A simple statistical method for predicting the functional differentiation of duplicate genes was developed. This method is based on the premise that the extent of functional differentiation between duplicate genes is reflected in the difference in evolutionary rate because the functional change of genes is often caused by relaxation or intensification of functional constraints. With this idea in mind, we developed a window analysis of protein sequences to identify the protein regions in which the significant rate difference exists. We applied this method to MIKC-type MADS-box proteins that control flower development in plants. We examined 23 pairs of sequences of floral MADS-box proteins from petunia and found that the rate differences for 14 pairs are significant. The significant rate differences were observed mostly in the K domain, which is important for dimerization between MADS-box proteins. These results indicate that our statistical method may be useful for predicting protein regions that are likely to be functionally differentiated. These regions may be chosen for further experimental studies.

In much of the tropics and subtropics, rice (Oryza sativa L.) is grown under long days (LDs). Therefore, LD must play a major role in inducing flowering signal in rice. However, little is known on LD-dependent flowering signal in the species. We previously reported that OsMADS50, which is highly homologous to Arabidopsis SOC1, functions as a positive regulator for flowering. However, its detailed photoperiodic mechanism was not yet elucidated. Here, we report the functional analysis of OsMADS50 and its closely related gene OsMADS56. Knock-out of OsMADS50 caused a late-flowering phenotype only under LD conditions. Overexpression of OsMADS56 (56OX) also resulted in delayed flowering under LD. In the osmads50 mutants and 56OX transgenic plants, transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 were reduced, although that of OsLFL1 increased. On the other hand, mRNA levels of OsGI, Hd1, OsId1, OsDof12, Ghd7, Hd6 and SE5 were unchanged. These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicated an interaction between those two proteins as well as their formation of homodimers. These results suggest that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 may form a complex that regulates downstream target genes.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
