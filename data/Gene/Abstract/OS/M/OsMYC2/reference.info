NA	Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice	2014	Nature Communications	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China	The spikelet is the basal unit of inflorescence in grasses, and its formation is crucial for reproductive success and cereal yield. Here, we report a previously unknown role of the plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) in determining rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet morphogenesis. The extra glume 1 (eg1) and eg2 mutants exhibit altered spikelet morphology with changed floral organ identity and number, as well as defective floral meristem determinacy. We show that EG1 is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1's degradation during spikelet development. OsJAZ1 also interacts with OsMYC2, a transcription factor in the JA signalling pathway, and represses OsMYC2's role in activating OsMADS1, an E-class gene crucial to the spikelet development. This work discovers a key regulatory mechanism of grass spikelet development and suggests that the role of JA in reproduction has diversified during the flowering plant evolution.
NA	Overexpression of OsMYC2 Results in the Up-Regulation of Early JA-Rresponsive Genes and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant Genome and Resource Research Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795 Japan.	JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins act as transcriptional repressors of jasmonic acid (JA) responses and play a crucial role in the regulation of host immunity in plants. Here, we report that OsMYC2, a JAZ-interacting transcription factor in rice (Oryza sativa L.), plays an important role in the resistance response against rice bacterial blight, which is one of the most serious diseases in rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The results showed that OsMYC2 interacted with some OsJAZ proteins in a JAZ-interacting domain (JID)-dependent manner. The up-regulation of OsMYC2 in response to JA was regulated by OsJAZ8. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMYC2 exhibited a JA-hypersensitive phenotype and were more resistant to Xoo. A large-scale microarray analysis revealed that OsMYC2 up-regulated OsJAZ10 as well as many other defense-related genes. OsMYC2 selectively bound to the G-box-like motif of the OsJAZ10 promoter in vivo and regulated the expression of early JA-responsive genes, but not of late JA-responsive genes. The nuclear localization of OsMYC2 depended on a nuclear localization signal within JID. Overall, we conclude that OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of early JA signals in the JA-induced resistance against Xoo in rice.
NA	OsMYC2, an essential factor for JA-inductive sakuranetin production in rice, interacts with MYC2-like proteins that enhance its transactivation ability.	2017	Sci Rep	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	Biosynthesis of sakuranetin, a flavonoid anti-fungal phytoalexin that occurs in rice, is highly dependent on jasmonic acid (JA) signalling and induced by a variety of environmental stimuli. We previously identified OsNOMT, which encodes naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT); NOMT is a key enzyme for sakuranetin production. Although OsNOMT expression is induced by JA treatment, the regulation mechanism that activates the biosynthetic pathway of sakuranetin has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we show that JA-inducible basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor OsMYC2 drastically enhances the activity of the OsNOMT promoter and is essential for JA-inducible sakuranetin production. In addition, we identified 2 collaborators of OsMYC2, OsMYC2-like protein 1 and 2 (OsMYL1 and OsMYL2) that further activated the OsNOMT promoter in synergy with OsMYC2. Physical interaction of OsMYC2 with OsMYL1 and OsMYL2 further supported the idea that these interactions lead to the enhancement of the transactivation activity of OsMYC2. Our results indicate that JA signalling via OsMYC2 is reinforced by OsMYL1 and OsMYL2, resulting in the inductive production of sakuranetin during defence responses in rice.
NA	OsMYC2 mediates numerous defence-related transcriptional changes via jasmonic acid signalling in rice.	2017	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	Jasmonic acid (JA) plays central roles in various events in plants, especially defence against pathogens and insects. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor MYC2 has attracted attention as a master regulator of JA signalling in dicotyledonous plants. However, how MYC2 functions in monocotyledonous plants, including agriculturally important crops such as cultivated rice, has been poorly understood. To elucidate the comprehensive effects of rice MYC2 (OsMYC2) on the JA-inducible transcriptional modifications, we performed RNA-sequencing by using OsMYC2-knockdown plants (osmyc2RNAi). In osmyc2RNAi, JA-inducible expression of many defence-related genes, for example chitinases and proteinase inhibitors, was compromised. Decrease in JA-dependent activation of the biosynthetic pathways of specialised metabolites, especially defence compounds, was also evident in the osmyc2RNAi line. Furthermore, a substantial change was noted in the expression of distinct types of transcription factors, such as MYB-type factors, likely depicting the importance of OsMYC2 in not only defence responses but also other morphogenetic events. Our findings provide fundamental information to understand the overall functions of MYC2 in JA signalling in monocotyledonous plants, which might yield agricultural benefits.
NA	Identification of OsMYC2-regulated senescence-associated genes in rice.	2017	Planta	Plant Genome and Resource Research Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795, Japan.	The jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive transcription factor OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of leaf senescence by direct regulation of some senescence-associated genes in rice. OsMYC2, a transcription factor (TF), acts as a positive regulator of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling involved in development and defense in rice. Here, we report that OsMYC2 plays an important role in leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence (DIS) conditions. Overexpression of OsMYC2 significantly promoted leaf senescence, indicated by reduction of chlorophyll content under DIS conditions in rice. Leaf senescence under the DIS conditions was negatively regulated by OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain protein involved in the JA signaling pathway. OsMYC2 upregulated the expression of some senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and selectively bound to the G-box/G-box-like motifs in the promoters of some SAGs in vivo. These results suggest that OsMYC2 acts as a positive regulator of leaf senescence by direct- or indirect-regulation of SAGs in rice.
NA	Rice MYC2 (OsMYC2) modulates light-dependent seedling phenotype, disease defence but not ABA signalling.	2017	J Biosci	School of life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110 067, India.	Arabidopsis MYC2 (AtMYC2) is a bHLH class transcription factor that mediates light-dependent seedling development, disease defence, JA and ABA signalling. AtMYC2 gene modulates hypocotyl elongation and expression of chlorophyll A/B binding protein 1 (CAB1) and rubisco small subunit protein1 (RBCS1) under blue light. The atmyc2 mutants are resistant against virulent bacterial pathogens. MYC2 orthologues from several crop plants have been characterized. The rice gene Os10g42430 has been referred earlier as OsMYC2 and has been shown to promote expression of JA-inducible genes. However, the role of OsMYC2 in seedling development under ABA, dark or light of specific wavelengths was not known. It was also not known whether OsMYC2 complements AtMYC2 function in Arabidopsis. We show here that expression of OsMYC2 in the atmyc2 mutant of Arabidopsis complements the blue-light-mediated defects in hypocotyl elongation and expression of CAB1 and RBCS1. We generated multiple transgenic rice lines for over-expression and RNAi-mediated suppression of OsMYC2. In agreement with AtMYC2 function, OsMYC2 over-expression and RNAi lines showed enhanced and suppressed seedling growth compared to WT plants respectively under blue light, and showed little effect under white light or dark. In agreement with the negative regulatory role of AtMYC2 in disease defence, the RNAi lines showed enhanced resistance against bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. However, in contrast to AtMYC2 function, OsMYC2 influences seedling development under red light and show no effect in ABA-mediated seed germination. Thus, the results suggest evolutionarily conserved as well as the distinct role of OsMYC2 in comparison with AtMYC2.
NA	OsJAZ13 Negatively Regulates Jasmonate Signaling and Activates Hypersensitive Cell Death Response in Rice	2020	Int J Mol Sci.	  State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins belong to the subgroup of TIFY family and act as key regulators of jasmonate (JA) responses in plants. To date, only a few JAZ proteins have been characterized in rice. Here, we report the identification and function of rice OsJAZ13 gene. The gene encodes three different splice variants: OsJAZ13a, OsJAZ13b, and OsJAZ13c. The expression of OsJAZ13 was mainly activated in vegetative tissues and transiently responded to JA and ethylene. Subcellular localization analysis indicated OsJAZ13a is a nuclear protein. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed OsJAZ13a directly interacts with OsMYC2, and also with OsCOI1, in a COR-dependent manner. Furthermore, OsJAZ13a recruited a general co-repressor OsTPL via an adaptor protein OsNINJA. Remarkably, overexpression of OsJAZ13a resulted in the attenuation of root by methyl JA. Furthermore, OsJAZ13a-overexpressing plants developed lesion mimics in the sheath after approximately 30-45 days of growth. Tillers with necrosis died a few days later. Gene-expression analysis suggested the role of OsJAZ13 in modulating the expression of JA/ethylene response-related genes to regulate growth and activate hypersensitive cell death. Taken together, these observations describe a novel regulatory mechanism in rice and provide the basis for elucidating the function of OsJAZ13 in signal transduction and cell death in plants. 
NA	Rice stripe virus suppresses jasmonic acid-mediated resistance by hijacking brassinosteroid signaling pathway in rice	2020	PLoS Pathog	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.	Rice stripe virus (RSV) is one of the most destructive viral diseases affecting rice production. However, so far, only one RSV resistance gene has been cloned, the molecular mechanisms underlying host-RSV interaction are still poorly understood. Here, we show that increasing levels or signaling of brassinosteroids (BR) and jasmonic acid (JA) can significantly enhance the resistance against RSV. On the contrary, plants impaired in BR or JA signaling are more susceptible to RSV. Moreover, the enhancement of RSV resistance conferred by BR is impaired in OsMYC2 (a key positive regulator of JA response) knockout plants, suggesting that BR-mediated RSV resistance requires active JA pathway. In addition, we found that RSV infection suppresses the endogenous BR levels to increase the accumulation of OsGSK2, a key negative regulator of BR signaling. OsGSK2 physically interacts with OsMYC2, resulting in the degradation of OsMYC2 by phosphorylation and reduces JA-mediated defense to facilitate virus infection. These findings not only reveal a novel molecular mechanism mediating the crosstalk between BR and JA in response to virus infection and deepen our understanding about the interaction of virus and plants, but also suggest new effective means of breeding RSV resistant crops using genetic engineering.
NA	Magnaporthe oryzae systemic defense trigger 1 (MoSDT1)-mediated metabolites regulate defense response in Rice	2021	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650201, China.	Background: Some of the pathogenic effector proteins play an active role in stimulating the plant defense system to strengthen plant resistance.  Results: In this study, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS) was implemented to identify altered metabolites in transgenic rice containing over-expressed M. oryzae Systemic Defense Trigger 1 (MoSDT1) that was infected at three-time points. The characterized dominating metabolites were organic acids and their derivatives, organic oxygen compounds, lipids, and lipid-like molecules. Among the identified metabolites, shikimate, galactinol, trehalose, D-mannose, linolenic acid, dopamine, tyramine, and L-glutamine are precursors for the synthesis of many secondary defense metabolites Carbohydrate, as well as amino acid metabolic, pathways were revealed to be involved in plant defense responses and resistance strengthening.  Conclusion: The increasing salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) content enhanced interactions between JA synthesis/signaling gene, SA synthesis/receptor gene, raffinose/fructose/sucrose synthase gene, and cell wall-related genes all contribute to defense response in rice. The symptoms of rice after M. oryzae infection were significantly alleviated when treated with six identified metabolites, i.e., galactol, tyramine, L-glutamine, L-tryptophan, ¦Á-terpinene, and dopamine for 72 h exogenously. Therefore, these metabolites could be utilized as an optimal metabolic marker for M. oryzae defense.
NA	OsPHR2 modulates phosphate starvation-induced OsMYC2 signaling and resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 	2021	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Institute of Virology and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China.	Phosphate (Pi) and MYC2-mediated jasmonate (JA) pathway play critical roles in plant growth and development. In particular, crosstalk between JA and Pi starvation signaling has been reported to mediate insect herbivory resistance in dicot plants. However, its roles and mechanism in monocot-bacterial defense systems remain obscure. Here, we report that Pi starvation in rice activates the OsMYC2 signaling and enhances resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection. The direct regulation of OsPHR2 on the OsMYC2 promoter was confirmed by yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, dual-luciferase, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Molecular analyses and infection studies using OsPHR2-Ov1 and phr2 mutants further demonstrated that OsPHR2 enhances antibacterial resistance via transcriptional regulation of OsMYC2 expression, indicating a positive role of OsPHR2-OsMYC2 crosstalk in modulating the OsMYC2 signaling and Xoo infection. Genetic analysis and infection assays using myc2 mutants revealed that Pi starvation-induced OsMYC2 signaling activation and consequent Xoo resistance depends on the regulation of OsMYC2. Together, these results reveal a clear interlink between Pi starvation- and OsMYC2- signaling in monocot plants, and provide new insight into how plants balance growth and defense by integrating nutrient deficiency and phytohormone signaling.

NA	Rice MEDIATOR25, OsMED25, is an essential subunit for jasmonate-mediated root development and OsMYC2-mediated leaf senescence 	2021	Plant Sci	Plant Genome and Resource Research Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795, Japan.	The Mediator multiprotein complex acts as a universal adaptor between transcription factors (TFs) and RNA polymerase II. MEDIATOR25 (MED25) has an important role in jasmonic acid (JA) signaling in Arabidopsis. However, no research has been conducted on the role of MED25 in JA signaling in rice, which is one of the most important food crops globally and is a model plant for molecular studies in other monocotyledonous species. In the present study, we isolated the loss-of function mutant of MED25, osmed25, through the map-based cloning and phenotypic complementation analysis by the introduction of OsMED25 and investigated the role of OsMED25 in JA signaling in rice. The osmed25 mutants had longer primary (seminal) roots than those of the wild-type (WT) and exhibited JA-insensitive phenotypes. S-type lateral root densities in osmed25 mutants were lower than those in the WT, whereas L-type lateral root densities in osmed25 mutants were higher than those in the WT. Furthermore, the osmed25 mutants retarded JA-regulated leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence. Mutated osmed25 protein could not interact with OsMYC2, which is a positive TF in JA signaling in rice. The expression of JA-responsive senescence-associated genes was not upregulated in response to JA in the osmed25 mutants. The results suggest that OsMED25 participates in JA-mediated root development and OsMYC2-mediated leaf senescence in rice.
