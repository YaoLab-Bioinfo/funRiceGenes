NA	Mediator subunit OsMED14_1 plays an important role in rice development.	2020	Plant J	National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR), Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.	Mediator, a multisubunit co-activator complex, regulates transcription in eukaryotes and is involved in diverse processes in Arabidopsis through its different subunits. Here, we have explored developmental aspects of one of the rice Mediator subunit gene OsMED14_1. We analyzed its expression pattern through RNA in situ hybridization and pOsMED14_1:GUS transgenics that showed its expression in roots, leaves, anthers and seeds prominently at younger stages, indicating possible involvement of this subunit in multiple aspects of rice development. To understand the developmental roles of OsMED14_1 in rice, we generated and studied RNAi-based knockdown rice plants that showed multiple effects including less height, narrower leaves and culms with reduced vasculature, lesser lateral root branching, defective microspore development, reduced panicle branching and seed set, and smaller seeds. Histological analyses showed that slender organs were caused by reduction in both cell number and cell size in OsMED14_1 knockdown plants. Flow cytometric analyses and expression analyses of cell cycle-related genes revealed that defective cell-cycle progression led to these defects. Expression analyses of auxin-related genes and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) immunolocalization study indicated altered auxin level in these knockdown plants. Reduction of lateral root branching in knockdown plants was corrected by exogenous IAA supplement. OsMED14_1 physically interacts with transcription factors YABBY5, TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR) and MADS29, possibly regulating auxin homeostasis and ultimately leading to lateral organ/leaf, microspore and seed development.
