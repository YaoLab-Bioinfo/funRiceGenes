J. Exp. Bot.-2013-Nayar-jxb-ert231.pdf	Functional delineation of rice MADS29 reveals its role in embryo and endosperm development by affecting hormone homeostasis	2013	J Exp Bot	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, New Delhi 110021, India.	Rice MADS29 has recently been reported to cause programmed cell death of maternal tissues, the nucellus, and the nucellar projection during early stages of seed development. However, analyses involving OsMADS29 protein expression domains and characterization of OsMADS29 gain-of-function and knockdown phenotypes revealed novel aspects of its function in maintaining hormone homeostasis, which may have a role in the development of embryo and plastid differentiation and starch filling in endosperm cells. The MADS29 transcripts accumulated to high levels soon after fertilization; however, protein accumulation was found to be delayed by at least 4 days. Immunolocalization studies revealed that the protein accumulated initially in the dorsal-vascular trace and the outer layers of endosperm, and subsequently in the embryo and aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm. Ectopic expression of MADS29 resulted in a severely dwarfed phenotype, exhibiting elevated levels of cytokinin, thereby suggesting that cytokinin biosynthesis pathway could be one of the major targets of OsMADS29. Overexpression of OsMADS29 in heterologous BY2 cells was found to mimic the effects of exogenous application of cytokinins that causes differentiation of proplastids to starch-containing amyloplasts and activation of genes involved in the starch biosynthesis pathway. Suppression of MADS29 expression by RNAi severely affected seed set. The surviving seeds were smaller in size, with developmental abnormalities in the embryo and reduced size of endosperm cells, which also contained loosely packed starch granules. Microarray analysis of overexpression and knockdown lines exhibited altered expression of genes involved in plastid biogenesis, starch biosynthesis, cytokinin signalling and biosynthesis.
PlantCell 2012.pdf	The MADS29 transcription factor regulates the degradation of the nucellus and the nucellar projection during rice seed development	2012	Plant Cell	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 20032 Shanghai, China.	The MADS box transcription factors are critical regulators of rice (Oryza sativa) reproductive development. Here, we here report the functional characterization of a rice MADS box family member, MADS29, which is preferentially expressed in the nucellus and the nucellar projection. Suppressed expression of MADS29 resulted in abnormal seed development; the seeds were shrunken, displayed a low grain-filling rate and suppressed starch biosynthesis, and contained abnormal starch granules. Detailed analysis indicated that the abnormal seed development is due to defective programmed cell death (PCD) of the nucellus and nucellar projection, which was confirmed by a TUNEL assay and transcriptome analysis. Further studies showed that expression of MADS29 is induced by auxin and MADS29 protein binds directly to the putative promoter regions of genes that encode a Cys protease and nucleotide binding site-Leu-rich repeat proteins, thereby stimulating the PCD. This study identifies MADS29 as a key regulator of early rice seed development by regulating the PCD of maternal tissues. It provides informative clues to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of maternal tissue degradation after fertilization and to facilitate the studies of endosperm development and seed filling.
pone.0051435.pdf	Live and let die - the B(sister) MADS-box gene OsMADS29 controls the degeneration of cells in maternal tissues during seed development of rice (Oryza sativa)	2012	PLoS One	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, PR China.	B(sister) genes have been identified as the closest relatives of class B floral homeotic genes. Previous studies have shown that B(sister) genes from eudicots are involved in cell differentiation during ovule and seed development. However, the complete function of B(sister) genes in eudicots is masked by redundancy with other genes and little is known about the function of B(sister) genes in monocots, and about the evolution of B(sister) gene functions. Here we characterize OsMADS29, one of three MADS-box B(sister) genes in rice. Our analyses show that OsMADS29 is expressed in female reproductive organs including the ovule, ovule vasculature, and the whole seed except for the outer layer cells of the pericarp. Knock-down of OsMADS29 by double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) results in shriveled and/or aborted seeds. Histological analyses of the abnormal seeds at 7 days after pollination (DAP) indicate that the symplastic continuity, including the ovular vascular trace and the nucellar projection, which is the nutrient source for the filial tissue at early development stages, is affected. Moreover, degeneration of all the maternal tissues in the transgenic seeds, including the pericarp, ovular vascular trace, integuments, nucellar epidermis and nucellar projection, is blocked as compared to control plants. Our results suggest that OsMADS29 has important functions in seed development of rice by regulating cell degeneration of maternal tissues. Our findings provide important insights into the ancestral function of B(sister) genes.
NA	Post-translational regulation of rice MADS29 function: homodimerization or binary interactions with other seed-expressed MADS proteins modulate its translocation into the nucleus.	2014	J Exp Bot	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, New Delhi 110021, India.	OsMADS29 is a seed-specific MADS-box transcription factor that affects embryo development and grain filling by maintaining hormone homeostasis and degradation of cells in the nucellus and nucellar projection. Although it has a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, the transiently expressed OsMADS29 monomer does not localize specifically in the nucleus. Dimerization of the monomers alters the intracellular localization fate of the resulting OsMADS29 homodimer, which then translocates into the nucleus. By generating domain-specific deletions/mutations, we show that two conserved amino acids (lysine(23) and arginine(24)) in the NLS are important for nuclear localization of the OsMADS29 homodimer. Furthermore, the analyses involving interaction of OsMADS29 with 30 seed-expressed rice MADS proteins revealed 19 more MADS-box proteins, including five E-class proteins, which interacted with OsMADS29. Eleven of these complexes were observed to be localized in the nucleus. Deletion analysis revealed that the KC region (K-box and C-terminal domain) plays a pivotal role in homodimerization. These data suggest that the biological function of OsMADS29 may not only be regulated at the level of transcription and translation as reported earlier, but also at the post-translational level by way of the interaction between OsMADS29 monomers, and between OsMADS29 and other MADS-box proteins.
NA	Characterization of Transcription Regulatory Domains of OsMADS29: Identification of Proximal Auxin-Responsive Domains and a Strong Distal Negative Element.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India.	OsMADS29 (M29) is a seed-specific MADS-box transcription factor involved in programmed cell death of nucellar tissue and maintaining auxin:cytokinin homeostasis. It affects embryo and endosperm development and starch filling during seed development in rice. Its expression seems to be tightly regulated by and trans-regulatory factors that affect its expression are largely unknown. In silico analysis of the 1.7 kb upstream regulatory region (URR) consisting of 1,290 bp promoter and 425 bp 5&#x27;-UTR regions revealed several auxin-responsive and seed-specific cis-regulatory elements distributed across the URR. In this study, the analysis of four URR deletions fused to a downstream β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter in transgenic rice has revealed the presence of several proximal positive elements and a strong distal negative element (NE). The promoter regions containing auxin-responsive elements responded positively to the exogenous application of auxins to transgenic seedlings. The proximal positive elements are capable of driving reporter expression in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. In contrast, the NE strongly suppresses reporter gene expression in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. In a transient onion peel assay system, the NE could reduce the efficacy of a 2x CaMV 35S promoter by ∼90%. Our results indicate the existence of a complex array of positive and negative regulatory regions along with auxin-responsive elements guiding the development-dependent and spatial expression of M29.
