NA	Oryza sativa mediator subunit OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice.	2020	J Integr Plant Biol	Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Key Laboratory of Soybean Molecular Design Breeding, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Harbin, 150081, China.	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant-specific steroid hormones that regulate plant growth, development, and adaptation. Transcriptional regulation plays key roles in plant hormone signaling. A mediator can serve as a bridge between gene-specific transcription factors and the RNA polymerase machinery, functioning as an essential component in regulating the transcriptional process. However, whether a mediator is involved in BR signaling is unknown. Here, we discovered that Oryza sativa mediator subunit 25 (OsMED25) is an important regulator of rice BR signaling. Phenotypic analyses showed that the OsMED25-RNAi and osmed25 mutant presented erect leaves, as observed in BR-deficient mutants. In addition, the OsMED25-RNAi and osmed25 mutant exhibited decreased BR sensitivity. Genetic analysis indicated that OsMED25-RNAi could suppress the enhanced BR signaling phenotype of Osbzr1-D. Further biochemical analysis showed that OsMED25 interacts with OsBZR1 in vivo, and OsMED25 is enriched on the promoter of OsBZR1 target genes. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that OsMED25 affects the expression of approximately 45% of OsBZR1-regulated genes and mainly functions as a co-repressor of OsBZR1. Together, these findings revealed that OsMED25 regulates rice BR signaling by interacting with OsBZR1 and modulating the expression of OsBZR1 target genes, thus expanding our understanding of the roles of mediators in plant hormone signaling.

NA	Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and OsMED25 in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice 	2021	Front Plant Sci	College of Life Science, Taizhou University, Taizhou, China.	Mediator complex is a multiprotein complex that regulates RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Moreover, it functions in several signaling pathways, including those involved in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to study the functions of two genes, namely OsMED16 and OsMED25 in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice. Both genes were differentially induced by Magnaporthe grisea (M. grisea), the causative agent of blast disease, hormone treatment, and abiotic stress. We found that both BMV: OsMED16- and BMV: OsMED25-infiltrated seedlings reduced the resistance to M. grisea by regulating the accumulation of H2O2 and expression of defense-related genes. Furthermore, BMV: OsMED16-infiltrated seedlings decreased the tolerance to cold by increasing the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and reducing the expression of cold-responsive genes. 
NA	Rice MEDIATOR25, OsMED25, is an essential subunit for jasmonate-mediated root development and OsMYC2-mediated leaf senescence	2021	Plant Sci	Plant Genome and Resource Research Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795, Japan.	The Mediator multiprotein complex acts as a universal adaptor between transcription factors (TFs) and RNA polymerase II. MEDIATOR25 (MED25) has an important role in jasmonic acid (JA) signaling in Arabidopsis. However, no research has been conducted on the role of MED25 in JA signaling in rice, which is one of the most important food crops globally and is a model plant for molecular studies in other monocotyledonous species. In the present study, we isolated the loss-of function mutant of MED25, osmed25, through the map-based cloning and phenotypic complementation analysis by the introduction of OsMED25 and investigated the role of OsMED25 in JA signaling in rice. The osmed25 mutants had longer primary (seminal) roots than those of the wild-type (WT) and exhibited JA-insensitive phenotypes. S-type lateral root densities in osmed25 mutants were lower than those in the WT, whereas L-type lateral root densities in osmed25 mutants were higher than those in the WT. Furthermore, the osmed25 mutants retarded JA-regulated leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence. Mutated osmed25 protein could not interact with OsMYC2, which is a positive TF in JA signaling in rice. The expression of JA-responsive senescence-associated genes was not upregulated in response to JA in the osmed25 mutants. The results suggest that OsMED25 participates in JA-mediated root development and OsMYC2-mediated leaf senescence in rice.
