OsBAG4	OsMYB106	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 Here, we present evidence that a protein complex consisting of rice BCL-2-ASSOCIATED ATHANOGENE4 (OsBAG4), OsMYB106, and OsSUVH7 regulates OsHKT1;5 expression in response to salt stress
OsBAG4	OsMYB106	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 OsBAG4 functioned as a bridge between OsSUVH7 and OsMYB106 to facilitate OsMYB106 binding to the consensus MYBE in the OsHKT1;5 promoter, thereby activating the OsHKT1;5 expression
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsMYB106	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 Here, we present evidence that a protein complex consisting of rice BCL-2-ASSOCIATED ATHANOGENE4 (OsBAG4), OsMYB106, and OsSUVH7 regulates OsHKT1;5 expression in response to salt stress
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsMYB106	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 Using comparative interactomics, we isolated two OsBAG4-interacting proteins, OsMYB106 (a MYB transcription factor) and OsSUVH7 (a DNA methylation reader), that were crucial for OsHKT1;5 expression
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsMYB106	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 OsMYB106 and OsSUVH7 bound to the MYB binding cis-element (MYBE) and the miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) upstream of the MYBE, respectively, in the OsHKT1;5 promoter
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsMYB106	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 OsBAG4 functioned as a bridge between OsSUVH7 and OsMYB106 to facilitate OsMYB106 binding to the consensus MYBE in the OsHKT1;5 promoter, thereby activating the OsHKT1;5 expression
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsMYB106	A DNA Methylation Reader-Chaperone Regulator-Transcription Factor Complex Activates OsHKT1;5 Expression during Salinity Stress	 Elimination of the MITE or knockout of OsMYB106 or OsSUVH7 decreased OsHKT1;5 expression and increased salt sensitivity
