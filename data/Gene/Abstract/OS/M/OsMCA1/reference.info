1471-2229-12-11.pdf	Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells	2012	BMC Plant Biol	Department of Applied Biological Science, Tokyo University of Science, 2641 Yamazaki, Noda, Chiba, Japan.	BACKGROUND: Mechanosensing and its downstream responses are speculated to involve sensory complexes containing Ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channels. On recognizing osmotic signals, plant cells initiate activation of a widespread signal transduction network that induces second messengers and triggers inducible defense responses. Characteristic early signaling events include Ca2+ influx, protein phosphorylation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pharmacological analyses show Ca2+ influx mediated by mechanosensitive Ca2+ channels to influence induction of osmotic signals, including ROS generation. However, molecular bases and regulatory mechanisms for early osmotic signaling events remain poorly elucidated. RESULTS: We here identified and investigated OsMCA1, the sole rice homolog of putative Ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channels in Arabidopsis (MCAs). OsMCA1 was specifically localized at the plasma membrane. A promoter-reporter assay suggested that OsMCA1 mRNA is widely expressed in seed embryos, proximal and apical regions of shoots, and mesophyll cells of leaves and roots in rice. Ca2+ uptake was enhanced in OsMCA1-overexpressing suspension-cultured cells, suggesting that OsMCA1 is involved in Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. Hypo-osmotic shock-induced ROS generation mediated by NADPH oxidases was also enhanced in OsMCA1-overexpressing cells. We also generated and characterized OsMCA1-RNAi transgenic plants and cultured cells; OsMCA1-suppressed plants showed retarded growth and shortened rachises, while OsMCA1-suppressed cells carrying Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin showed partially impaired changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) induced by hypo-osmotic shock and trinitrophenol, an activator of mechanosensitive channels. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a sole MCA ortholog in the rice genome and developed both overexpression and suppression lines. Analyses of cultured cells with altered levels of this putative Ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channel indicate that OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of plasma membrane Ca2+ influx and ROS generation induced by hypo-osmotic stress in cultured rice cells. These findings shed light on our understanding of mechanical sensing pathways.
psb-7-796.pdf	Roles of a putative mechanosensitive plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable channel OsMCA1 in generation of reactive oxygen species and hypo-osmotic signaling in rice	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Department of Applied Biological Science, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan.	Mechanosensing and its downstream responses are speculated to involve sensory complexes containing Ca(2+)-permeable mechanosensitive channels. On recognizing hypo-osmotic stress, plant cells initiate activation of a widespread signal transduction network involving second messengers such as Ca(2+) to trigger inducible defense responses including the induction of transcriptional factors. However, most of the components involved in these signaling networks still remain to be identified. Recently we identified and investigated OsMCA1, the sole homolog of the MCA family putative Ca(2+)-permeable mechanosensitive channels in rice. Functional characterization of the OsMCA1-suppressed cells as well as the overexpressing cells indicated that OsMCA1 is involved in the regulation of plasma membrane Ca(2+) influx and NADPH oxidase-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by hypo-osmotic stress. Here we will discuss possible molecular mechanisms and physiological functions of the MCA protein in hypo-osmotic signaling.
NA	A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice	2014	Plant Molecular Biology	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Luojia Hill, Wuhan, 430072, Hubei Province, China	Plant architecture directly affects biomass in higher plants, especially grain yields in agricultural crops. In this study, we characterized a recessive mutant, plant architecture determinant (pad), derived from the Oryza sativa ssp. indica cultivar MH86. The mutant exhibited severe dwarf phenotypes, including shorter and stunted leaves, fewer secondary branches during both the vegetative and reproductive growth stages. Cytological studies revealed that pad mutant growth defects are primarily due to the inhibition of cell expansion. The PAD gene was isolated using a map-based cloning strategy. It encodes a plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 and a SNP responsible for a single amino acid change was found in the mutant. PAD was universally expressed in rice tissues from the vegetative to reproductive growth stages, especially in seedlings, nodes and rachillae. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the most of the genes responding to gibberellin (GA) metabolism were up-regulated in pad mutant internodes. The endogenous GA content measurement revealed that the levels of GA1 were significantly decreased in the third internode of pad mutants. Moreover, a GA response assay suggested that OsMCA1/PAD might be involved in the regulation of GA metabolism and signal transduction. Our results revealed the pad is a loss-of-function mutant of the OsMCA1/PAD, leading to upregulation of genes related to GA deactivation, which decreased bioactive GA levels.
NA	Plasma Membrane Ca2+ Permeable Mechanosensitive Channel OsDMT1 Is Involved in Regulation of Plant Architecture and Ion Homeostasis in Rice.	2020	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Plant architecture is an important factor for crop production. Plant height, tiller pattern, and panicle morphology are decisive factors for high grain yield in rice. Here, we isolated and characterized a T-DNA insertion rice mutant Osdmt1 (Oryza sativa dwarf and multi-tillering1) that exhibited a severe dwarf phenotype and multi-tillering. Molecular cloning revealed that DMT1 encodes a plasma membrane protein that was identified as a putative Ca2+ permeable mechanosensitive channel. The transcript expression level was significantly higher in the dmt1 mutant compared to wild type (WT). Additionally, the dmt1 homozygous mutant displayed a stronger phenotype than that of the WT and heterozygous seedlings after gibberellic acid (GA) treatment. RNA-seq and iTRAQ-based proteome analyses were performed between the dmt1 mutant and WT. The transcriptome profile revealed that several genes involved in GA and strigolactone (SL) biosyntheses were altered in the dmt1 mutant. Ca2+ and other ion concentrations were significantly enhanced in the dmt1 mutant, suggesting that DMT1 contributes to the accumulation of several ions in rice. Moreover, several EF-hand Ca2+ sensors, including CMLs (CaM-like proteins) and CDPKs (calcium-dependent protein kinases), displayed markedly altered transcript expression and protein levels in the dmt1 mutant. Overall, these findings aid in the elucidation of the multiply regulatory roles of OsDMT1/OsMCA1 in rice.
