OsMCA1|PAD|OsDMT1	seed	Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells	A promoter-reporter assay suggested that OsMCA1 mRNA is widely expressed in seed embryos, proximal and apical regions of shoots, and mesophyll cells of leaves and roots in rice
OsMCA1|PAD|OsDMT1	shoot	Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells	A promoter-reporter assay suggested that OsMCA1 mRNA is widely expressed in seed embryos, proximal and apical regions of shoots, and mesophyll cells of leaves and roots in rice
OsMCA1|PAD|OsDMT1	root	Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells	A promoter-reporter assay suggested that OsMCA1 mRNA is widely expressed in seed embryos, proximal and apical regions of shoots, and mesophyll cells of leaves and roots in rice
OsMCA1|PAD|OsDMT1	growth	Plasma membrane protein OsMCA1 is involved in regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ influx and modulates generation of reactive oxygen species in cultured rice cells	We also generated and characterized OsMCA1-RNAi transgenic plants and cultured cells; OsMCA1-suppressed plants showed retarded growth and shortened rachises, while OsMCA1-suppressed cells carrying Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin showed partially impaired changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) induced by hypo-osmotic shock and trinitrophenol, an activator of mechanosensitive channels

OsMCA1|PAD|OsDMT1	architecture	A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice	A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice
OsMCA1|PAD|OsDMT1	GA	A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice	A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice
OsMCA1|PAD|OsDMT1	GA deactivation	A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice	Our results revealed the pad is a loss-of-function mutant of the OsMCA1/PAD, leading to upregulation of genes related to GA deactivation, which decreased bioactive GA levels.
OsMCA1|PAD|OsDMT1	seedlings	A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice	PAD was universally expressed in rice tissues from the vegetative to reproductive growth stages, especially in seedlings, nodes and rachillae.
OsMCA1|PAD|OsDMT1	node	A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice	PAD was universally expressed in rice tissues from the vegetative to reproductive growth stages, especially in seedlings, nodes and rachillae.
OsMCA1|PAD|OsDMT1	rachillae	A SNP in OsMCA1 responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice	PAD was universally expressed in rice tissues from the vegetative to reproductive growth stages, especially in seedlings, nodes and rachillae.
