NA	MADS-box Transcription Factor OsMADS25 Regulates Root Development through Affection of Nitrate Accumulation in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	Zhejiang Key Lab of Crop Germplasm, Department of Agronomy, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	MADS-box transcription factors are vital regulators participating in plant growth and development process and the functions of most of them are still unknown. ANR1 was reported to play a key role in controlling lateral root development through nitrate signal in Arabidopsis. OsMADS25 is one of five ANR1-like genes in Oryza Sativa and belongs to the ANR1 clade. Here we have investigated the role of OsMADS25 in the plant's responses to external nitrate in Oryza Sativa. Our results showed that OsMADS25 protein was found in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm. Over-expression of OsMADS25 significantly promoted lateral and primary root growth as well as shoot growth in a nitrate-dependent manner in Arabidopsis. OsMADS25 overexpression in transgenic rice resulted in significantly increased primary root length, lateral root number, lateral root length and shoot fresh weight in the presence of nitrate. Down-regulation of OsMADS25 in transgenic rice exhibited significantly reduced shoot and root growth in the presence of nitrate. Furthermore, over-expression of OsMADS25 in transgenic rice promoted nitrate accumulation and significantly increased the expressions of nitrate transporter genes at high rates of nitrate supply while down-regulation of OsMADS25 produced the opposite effect. Taken together, our findings suggest that OsMADS25 is a positive regulator control lateral and primary root development in rice.
NA	OsMADS25 regulates root system development via auxin signaling in rice.	2018	Plant J	Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400030, P. R. China.	The phytohormone auxin is essential for root development in plants. OsMADS25 is a homolog of the AGL17-clade MADS-box genes in rice. In spite of recent progress, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of root development by OsMADS25 are not well known. It is unclear whether OsMADS25 regulates root development via auxin signaling. In this study, we examined the role of OsMADS25 in root development and characterized the signaling pathway through which OsMADS25 regulates root system development in rice. OsMADS25 overexpression significantly increased, but RNAi gene silencing repressed primary root (PR) length and lateral root (LR) density. Moreover, OsMADS25 promoted LR development in response to NO3- . Further study showed that OsMADS25 increased auxin accumulation in the root system by enhancing auxin biosynthesis and transport, while also reducing auxin degradation, thus stimulating root development. More importantly, OsMADS25 was found to regulate OsIAA14 expression directly by binding to the CArG-box in the promoter region of OsIAA14, which encodes an Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor of auxin signaling. Elevated auxin levels and decreased OsIAA14 expression might lead to reduced OsIAA14 protein accumulation, as a mechanism to regulate auxin signaling. Therefore, our findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which OsMADS25 modulates root system growth and development in rice, at least partilly, via Aux/IAA-based auxin signaling.

NA	Rice transcription factor OsMADS25 modulates root growth and confers salinity tolerance via the ABA-mediated regulatory pathway and ROS scavenging.	2018	PLoS Genet	Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, P. R. China.	Plant roots are constantly exposed to a variety of abiotic stresses, and high salinity is one of the major limiting conditions that impose constraints on plant growth. In this study, we describe that OsMADS25 is required for the root growth as well as salinity tolerance, via maintaining ROS homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa). Overexpression of OsMADS25 remarkably enhanced the primary root (PR) length and lateral root (LR) density, whereas RNAi silence of this gene reduced PR elongation significantly, with altered ROS accumulation in the root tip. Transcriptional activation assays indicated that OsMADS25 activates OsGST4 (glutathione S-transferase) expression directly by binding to its promoter. Meanwhile, osgst4 mutant exhibited repressed growth and high sensitivity to salinity and oxidative stress, and recombinant OsGST4 protein was found to have ROS-scavenging activity in vitro. Expectedly, overexpression of OsMADS25 significantly enhanced the tolerance to salinity and oxidative stress in rice plants, with the elevated activity of antioxidant enzymes, increased accumulation of osmoprotective solute proline and reduced frequency of open stoma. Furthermore, OsMADS25 specifically activated the transcription of OsP5CR, a key component of proline biosynthesis, by binding to its promoter. Interestingly, overexpression of OsMADS25 raised the root sensitivity to exogenous ABA, and the expression of ABA-dependent stress-responsive genes was elevated greatly in overexpression plants under salinity stress. In addition, OsMADS25 seemed to promote auxin signaling by activating OsYUC4 transcription. Taken together, our findings reveal that OsMADS25 might be an important transcriptional regulator that regulates the root growth and confers salinity tolerance in rice via the ABA-mediated regulatory pathway and ROS scavenging.
