NA	Overexpression of a methyl-CpG-binding protein gene OsMBD707 leads to larger tiller angles and reduced photoperiod sensitivity in rice	2021	BMC Plant Biol	Marine and Agricultural Biotechnology Laboratory, Institute of Oceanography, Minjiang University, Fuzhou, 350108, China.	Background: Methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins play important roles in epigenetic gene regulation, and have diverse molecular, cellular, and biological functions in plants. MBD proteins have been functionally characterized in various plant species, including Arabidopsis, wheat, maize, and tomato. In rice, 17 sequences were bioinformatically predicted as putative MBD proteins. However, very little is known regarding the function of MBD proteins in rice.  Results: We explored the expression patterns of the rice OsMBD family genes and identified 13 OsMBDs with active expression in various rice tissues. We further characterized the function of a rice class I MBD protein OsMBD707, and demonstrated that OsMBD707 is constitutively expressed and localized in the nucleus. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsMBD707 displayed larger tiller angles and reduced photoperiod sensitivity-delayed flowering under short day (SD) and early flowering under long day (LD). RNA-seq analysis revealed that overexpression of OsMBD707 led to reduced photoperiod sensitivity in rice and to expression changes in flowering regulator genes in the Ehd1-Hd3a/RFT1 pathway.  Conclusion: The results of this study suggested that OsMBD707 plays important roles in rice growth and development, and should lead to further studies on the functions of OsMBD proteins in growth, development, or other molecular, cellular, and biological processes in rice.
