OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	The OsMYB30 transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing beta-amylase expression.	Furthermore, we identified an OsMYB30-interacting protein OsJAZ9 that had a significant effect in suppressing the transcriptional activation of OsMYB30 and in the repression of BMY genes mediated by OsMYB30
OsJAZ9|OsTIFY11a	OsMYB30|OsMYB5P	The OsMYB30 transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing beta-amylase expression.	These results together suggested that OsMYB30 might be a novel regulator of cold tolerance through the negative regulation of the BMY genes by interacting with OsJAZ9 to fine tune the starch breakdown and the content of maltose which might contribute to the cold tolerance as a compatible solute
