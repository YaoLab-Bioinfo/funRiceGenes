OsMKK4|LARGE11	brassinosteroid	SMALL GRAIN 1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, influences grain size in rice	Further results revealed that OsMKK4 influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression of BR-related genes
OsMKK4|LARGE11	root	Arsenic stress activates MAP kinase in rice roots and leaves	Among MAPK kinase (MKKs) gene family, OsMKK4 transcripts were found to be induced in arsenite treated rice leaves and roots
OsMKK4|LARGE11	arsenite	Arsenic stress activates MAP kinase in rice roots and leaves	Among MAPK kinase (MKKs) gene family, OsMKK4 transcripts were found to be induced in arsenite treated rice leaves and roots
OsMKK4|LARGE11	grain	SMALL GRAIN 1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, influences grain size in rice	Thus, our findings have identified OsMKK4 as a factor for grain size, and suggest a possible link between the MAPK pathways and BRs in grain growth
OsMKK4|LARGE11	grain size	SMALL GRAIN 1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, influences grain size in rice	Thus, our findings have identified OsMKK4 as a factor for grain size, and suggest a possible link between the MAPK pathways and BRs in grain growth
OsMKK4|LARGE11	growth	SMALL GRAIN 1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4, influences grain size in rice	Thus, our findings have identified OsMKK4 as a factor for grain size, and suggest a possible link between the MAPK pathways and BRs in grain growth
OsMKK4|LARGE11	wounding response	Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice	Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice
OsMKK4|LARGE11	biotic stress	Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 in the Wounding Response in Rice	Taken together, components involving in the wounding signaling pathway, OsMKK4-OsMPK1-OsWRKY53, can be important players in regulating crosstalk between abiotic stress and biotic stress.
