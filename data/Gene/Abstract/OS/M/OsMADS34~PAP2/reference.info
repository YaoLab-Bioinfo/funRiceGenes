nph12657.pdf	The pleiotropic SEPALLATA-like gene OsMADS34 reveals that the 'empty glumes' of rice (Oryza sativa) spikelets are in fact rudimentary lemmas	2014	New Phytol	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China.	The single floret of the rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet is subtended by a pair of enigmatic organs usually termed 'empty glumes' or 'sterile lemmas'. As the identity of these organs remains essentially unknown, we refer to them as 'organs of unknown identity' (OUIs). Here we present a novel mutant of the rice SEPALLATA-like gene OsMADS34 which develops, in addition to disorganized branches and sterile seeds, elongated OUIs. The function and evolution of OsMADS34 were studied. Morphological and molecular markers indicate that the elongated OUIs have adopted lemma identity. Evolutionary analyses show that the ancestral genes of the OsM34 subclade evolved under positive selection, and that three specific motifs occur in the C-terminal region of proteins in the OsM34 subclade. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that the C-terminal region of OsMADS34 plays a crucial role in mediating protein interactions. Sequence analyses for the wild rice Oryza grandiglumis which has elongated OUIs revealed the association of OsMADS34 functionality with OUI identity. Our findings support the hypothesis that OUIs originated from the lemmas of degenerate florets under the negative control of OsMADS34. As OUIs neither are homologues to glumes nor have the identity of lemmas any more, but originated from these organs, we suggest calling them 'rudimentary lemmas'.
pcp166.pdf	PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2), encoding a SEPALLATA subfamily MADS-box protein, positively controls spikelet meristem identity in rice	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.	In rice panicle development, new meristems are generated sequentially in an organized manner and acquire their identity in a time- and position-dependent manner. In the panicle of the panicle phytomer2-1 (pap2-1) mutant, the pattern of meristem initiation is disorganized and newly formed meristems show reduced competency to become spikelet meristems, resulting in the transformation of early arising spikelets into rachis branches. In addition, rudimentary glumes and sterile lemmas, the outermost organs of the spikelet, elongate into a leafy morphology. We propose that PAP2 is a positive regulator of spikelet meristem identity. Map-based cloning revealed that PAP2 encodes OsMADS34, a member of the SEPALLATA (SEP) subfamily of MADS-box proteins. PAP2/OsMADS34 belongs to the LOFSEP subgroup of MADS-box genes that show grass-specific diversification caused by gene duplication events. All five SEP subfamily genes in rice are expressed exclusively during panicle development, while their spatial and temporal expression patterns vary. PAP2 expression starts the earliest among the five SEP genes, and a low but significant level of PAP2 mRNA was detected in the inflorescence meristem, in branch meristems immediately after the transition, and in glume primordia, consistent with its role in the early development of spikelet formation. Our study provides new evidence supporting the hypothesis that the genes of the LOFSEP subgroup control developmental processes that are unique to grass species.
Plant Cell-2012-Kobayashi-tpc.112.097105.pdf	Inflorescence meristem identity in rice is specified by overlapping functions of three AP1/FUL-like MADS box genes and PAP2, a SEPALLATA MADS box gene	2012	Plant Cell	Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.	In plants, the transition to reproductive growth is of particular importance for successful seed production. Transformation of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to the inflorescence meristem (IM) is the crucial first step in this transition. Using laser microdissection and microarrays, we found that expression of PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2) and three APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL)-like genes (MADS14, MADS15, and MADS18) is induced in the SAM during meristem phase transition in rice (Oryza sativa). PAP2 is a MADS box gene belonging to a grass-specific subclade of the SEPALLATA subfamily. Suppression of these three AP1/FUL-like genes by RNA interference caused a slight delay in reproductive transition. Further depletion of PAP2 function from these triple knockdown plants inhibited the transition of the meristem to the IM. In the quadruple knockdown lines, the meristem continued to generate leaves, rather than becoming an IM. Consequently, multiple shoots were formed instead of an inflorescence. PAP2 physically interacts with MAD14 and MADS15 in vivo. Furthermore, the precocious flowering phenotype caused by the overexpression of Hd3a, a rice florigen gene, was weakened in pap2-1 mutants. Based on these results, we propose that PAP2 and the three AP1/FUL-like genes coordinately act in the meristem to specify the identity of the IM downstream of the florigen signal.
Plant Physiol.-2010-Gao-728-40.pdf	The SEPALLATA-like gene OsMADS34 is required for rice inflorescence and spikelet development	2010	Plant Physiol	School of Life Science and Biotechnology , Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	Grass plants develop distinct inflorescences and spikelets that determine grain yields. However, the mechanisms underlying the specification of inflorescences and spikelets in grasses remain largely unknown. Here, we report the biological role of one SEPALLATA (SEP)-like gene, OsMADS34, in controlling the development of inflorescences and spikelets in rice (Oryza sativa). OsMADS34 encodes a MADS box protein containing a short carboxyl terminus without transcriptional activation activity in yeast cells. We demonstrate the ubiquitous expression of OsMADS34 in roots, leaves, and primordia of inflorescence and spikelet organs. Compared with the wild type, osmads34 mutants developed altered inflorescence morphology, with an increased number of primary branches and a decreased number of secondary branches. In addition, osmads34 mutants displayed a decreased spikelet number and altered spikelet morphology, with lemma/leaf-like elongated sterile lemmas. Moreover, analysis of the double mutant osmads34 osmads1 suggests that OsMADS34 specifies the identities of floral organs, including the lemma/palea, lodicules, stamens, and carpel, in combination with another rice SEP-like gene, OsMADS1. Collectively, our study suggests that the origin and diversification of OsMADS34 and OsMADS1 contribute to the origin of distinct grass inflorescences and spikelets.
NA	Regulatory Role of OsMADS34 in the Determination of Glumes Fate, Grain Yield, and Quality in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute Zhejiang, China.	Grasses produce seeds on spikelets, a unique type of inflorescence. Despite the importance of grass crops for food, the genetic mechanisms that control spikelet development remain poorly understood. In this study, we used m34-z, a new mutant allele of the rice (Oryza sativa) E-class gene OsMADS34, to examine OsMADS34 function in determining the identities of glumes (rudimentary glume and sterile lemma) and grain size. In the m34-z mutant, both the rudimentary glume and sterile lemma were homeotically converted to the lemma-like organ and acquired the lemma identity, suggesting that OsMADS34 plays important roles in the development of glumes. In the m34-z mutant, most of the grains from the secondary panicle branches (spb) were decreased in size, compared with grains from wild-type, but no differences were observed in the grains from the primary panicle branches. The amylose content and gel consistency, and a seed-setting rate from the spb were reduced in the m34-z mutant. Interesting, transcriptional activity analysis revealed that OsMADS34 protein was a transcription repressor and it may influence grain yield by suppressing the expressions of BG1, GW8, GW2, and GL7 in the m34-z mutant. These findings revealed that OsMADS34 largely affects grain yield by affecting the size of grains from the secondary branches.
NA	Regulatory network and genetic interactions established by OsMADS34 in rice inflorescence and spikelet morphogenesis.	2017	J Integr Plant Biol	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic &amp; Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	Grasses display highly diversified inflorescence architectures that differ in the arrangement of spikelets and flowers and determine cereal yields. However, the molecular basis underlying grass inflorescence morphogenesis remains largely unknown. Here we investigate the role of a functionally diversified SEPALLATA MADS-box transcription factor, OsMADS34, in regulating rice (Oryza sativa L.) inflorescence and spikelet development. Microarray analysis showed that, at the very early stages of inflorescence formation, dysfunction of OsMADS34 caused altered expression of 379 genes that are associated with protein modification and degradation, transcriptional regulation, signaling and metabolism activity. Genetic analysis revealed that OsMADS34 controls different aspects of inflorescence structure, branching and meristem activity synergistically with LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), as evidenced by the enhanced phenotypes of osmads34 lax1 and osmads34 fon4 compared with the single mutants. Additionally, double mutant between osmads34 and the sterile lemma defective mutant elongated empty glume (ele) displayed an enhanced phenotype, i.e. longer and wider sterile lemmas that were converted into lemma/palea like organs, suggesting that ELE and OsMADS34 synergistically control the sterile lemma development. OsMADS34 may act together OsMADS15 in controlling sterile lemma development. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the regulatory function of OsMADS34 in rice inflorescence and spikelet development.
NA	Cloning of long sterile lemma (lsl2), a single recessive gene that regulates spike germination in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2020	BMC Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fujian High Quality Rice Research & Development Center, Fuzhou, 350019, China. dewei-y@163.com.	Background: Rice is a typical monocotyledonous plant and an important cereal crop. The structural units of rice flowers are spikelets and florets, and floral organ development and spike germination affect rice reproduction and yield.  Results: In this study, we identified a novel long sterile lemma (lsl2) mutant from an EMS population. First, we mapped the lsl2 gene between the markers Indel7-22 and Indel7-27, which encompasses a 25-kb region. The rice genome annotation indicated the presence of four candidate genes in this region. Through gene prediction and cDNA sequencing, we confirmed that the target gene in the lsl2 mutant is allelic to LONG STERILE LEMMA1 (G1)/ELONGATED EMPTY GLUME (ELE), hereafter referred to as lsl2. Further analysis of the lsl2 and LSL2 proteins showed a one-amino-acid change, namely, the mutation of serine (Ser) 79 to proline (Pro) in lsl2 compared with LSL2, and this mutation might change the function of the protein. Knockout experiments showed that the lsl2 gene is responsible for the long sterile lemma phenotype. The lsl2 gene might reduce the damage induced by spike germination by decreasing the seed germination rate, but other agronomic traits of rice were not changed in the lsl2 mutant. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the lsl2 gene will have specific application prospects in future rice breeding.  Conclusions: The lsl2 gene is responsible for the long sterile lemma phenotype and might reduce the damage induced by spike germination by decreasing the seed germination rate.
NA	OsMADS32 Regulates Rice Floral Patterning through Interactions with Multiple Floral Homeotic Genes	2020	J Exp Bot	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	Floral patterning is regulated by intricate networks of floral identity genes. The peculiar MADS32 subfamily genes, absent in eudicots but prevalent in monocots, regulate floral organ identity. However, how the MADS32 family genes interact with other floral homeotic genes during flower development is mostly unknown. We show here that the rice homeotic transcription factor OsMADS32 regulates floral patterning by interacting synergistically with E class protein OsMADS6 in a dosage-dependent manner. Furthermore, our results indicate important roles of OsMADS32 in defining stamen, pistil and ovule development through physical and genetic interactions with OsMADS1, OsMADS58 and OsMADS13, and in specifying floral meristem identity with OsMADS6, OsMADS3 and OsMADS58 respectively. Our findings suggest that OsMADS32 is an important factor for floral meristem identity maintenance and that it integrates the action of other MADS-box homeotic proteins to sustain floral organ specification and development in rice. Given that OsMADS32 is an orphan gene and absent in eudicots, our data substantially expand our understanding of flower development in plants.
