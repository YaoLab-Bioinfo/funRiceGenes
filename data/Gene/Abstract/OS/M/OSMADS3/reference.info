In recent years, there have been reports on genomic localization, protein motif structure, phylogenetic relationships, gene structure and expression of the entire MADS-box family in the model plant system, Arabidopsis. Though there have been some studies in rice as well, an analysis of the complete MADS-box family along with a comprehensive expression profiling was still awaited after the completion of rice genome sequencing. Furthermore, owing to the role of MADS-box family in flower development, an analysis involving structure, expression and functional aspects of MADS-box genes in rice and Arabidopsis was required to understand the role of this gene family in reproductive development. RESULTS: A genome-wide molecular characterization and microarray-based expression profiling of the genes encoding MADS-box transcription factor family in rice is presented. Using a thorough annotation exercise, 75 MADS-box genes have been identified in rice and categorized into MIKCc, MIKC*, Malpha, Mbeta and Mgamma groups based on phylogeny. Chromosomal localization of these genes reveals that 16 MADS-box genes, mostly MIKCc-type, are located within the duplicated segments of the rice genome, whereas most of the M-type genes, 20 in all, seem to have resulted from tandem duplications. Nine members belonging to the Mbeta group, which was considered absent in monocots, have also been identified. The expression profiles of all the MADS-box genes have been analyzed under 11 temporal stages of panicle and seed development, three abiotic stress conditions, along with three stages of vegetative development. Transcripts for 31 genes accumulate preferentially in the reproductive phase, of which, 12 genes are specifically expressed in seeds, and six genes show expression specific to panicle development. Differential expression of seven genes under stress conditions is also evident. An attempt has been made to gain insight into plausible functions of rice MADS-box genes by collating the expression data of functionally validated genes in rice and Arabidopsis. CONCLUSION: Only a limited number of MADS genes have been functionally validated in rice. A comprehensive annotation and transcriptome profiling undertaken in this investigation adds to our understanding of the involvement of MADS-box family genes during reproductive development and stress in rice and also provides the basis for selection of candidate genes for functional validation studies.
263.pdf	Genetic interaction of OsMADS3, DROOPING LEAF, and OsMADS13 in specifying rice floral organ identities and meristem determinacy	2011	Plant Physiol	School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	Grass plants develop unique floral patterns that determine grain production. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the specification of floral organ identities and meristem determinacy, including the interaction among floral homeotic genes, remains largely unknown in grasses. Here, we report the interactions of rice (Oryza sativa) floral homeotic genes, OsMADS3 (a C-class gene), OsMADS13 (a D-class gene), and DROOPING LEAF (DL), in specifying floral organ identities and floral meristem determinacy. The interaction among these genes was revealed through the analysis of double mutants. osmads13-3 osmads3-4 displayed a loss of floral meristem determinacy and generated abundant carpelloid structures containing severe defective ovules in the flower center, which were not detectable in the single mutant. In addition, in situ hybridization and yeast two-hybrid analyses revealed that OsMADS13 and OsMADS3 did not regulate each other's transcription or interact at the protein level. This indicates that OsMADS3 plays a synergistic role with OsMADS13 in both ovule development and floral meristem termination. Strikingly, osmads3-4 dl-sup6 displayed a severe loss of floral meristem determinacy and produced supernumerary whorls of lodicule-like organs at the forth whorl, suggesting that OsMADS3 and DL synergistically terminate the floral meristem. Furthermore, the defects of osmads13-3 dl-sup6 flowers appeared identical to those of dl-sup6, and the OsMADS13 expression was undetectable in dl-sup6 flowers. These observations suggest that DL and OsMADS13 may function in the same pathway specifying the identity of carpel/ovule and floral meristem. Collectively, we propose a model to illustrate the role of OsMADS3, DL, and OsMADS13 in the specification of flower organ identity and meristem determinacy in rice.
2850.pdf	Functional analysis of all AGAMOUS subfamily members in rice reveals their roles in reproductive organ identity determination and meristem determinacy	2011	Plant Cell	Dipartimento di Scienze Biomolecolari e Biotecnologie, Universita degli Studi di Milano, 20133 Milan, Italy.	Reproductive organ development is one of the most important steps in the life cycle of plants. Studies using core eudicot species like thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) and snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) have shown that MADS domain transcription factors belonging to the AGAMOUS (AG) subfamily regulate the identity of stamens, carpels, and ovules and that they are important for floral meristem determinacy. Here, we investigate the genetic interactions between the four rice (Oryza sativa) AG subfamily members, MADS3, MADS13, MADS21, and MADS58. Our data show that, in contrast with previous reports, MADS3 and MADS58 determine stamen and carpel identity and, together with MADS13, are important for floral meristem determinacy. In the mads3 mads58 double mutant, we observed a complete loss of reproductive organ identity and massive accumulation of lodicules in the third and fourth floral whorls. MADS21 is an AGL11 lineage gene whose expression is not restricted to ovules. Instead, its expression profile is similar to those of class C genes. However, our genetic analysis shows that MADS21 has no function in stamen, carpel, or ovule identity determination.
Plant Cell-2006-Yamaguchi-15-28.pdf	Functional diversification of the two C-class MADS box genes OSMADS3 and OSMADS58 in Oryza sativa	2006	Plant Cell	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Japan.	The C-class MADS box gene AGAMOUS (AG) plays crucial roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development by regulating the organ identity of stamens and carpels, the repression of A-class genes, and floral meristem determinacy. To examine the conservation and diversification of C-class gene function in monocots, we analyzed two C-class genes in rice (Oryza sativa), OSMADS3 and OSMADS58, which may have arisen by gene duplication before divergence of rice and maize (Zea mays). A knockout line of OSMADS3, in which the gene is disrupted by T-DNA insertion, shows homeotic transformation of stamens into lodicules and ectopic development of lodicules in the second whorl near the palea where lodicules do not form in the wild type but carpels develop almost normally. By contrast, RNA-silenced lines of OSMADS58 develop astonishing flowers that reiterate a set of floral organs, including lodicules, stamens, and carpel-like organs, suggesting that determinacy of the floral meristem is severely affected. These results suggest that the two C-class genes have been partially subfunctionalized during rice evolution (i.e., the functions regulated by AG have been partially partitioned into two paralogous genes, OSMADS3 and OSMADS58, which were produced by a recent gene duplication event in plant evolution).
Plant Cell-2011-Hu-515-33.pdf	Rice MADS3 regulates ROS homeostasis during late anther development	2011	Plant Cell	School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	The rice (Oryza sativa) floral homeotic C-class gene, MADS3, was previously shown to be required for stamen identity determination during early flower development. Here, we describe a role for MADS3 in regulating late anther development and pollen formation. Consistent with this role, MADS3 is highly expressed in the tapetum and microspores during late anther development, and a newly identified MADS3 mutant allele, mads3-4, displays defective anther walls, aborted microspores, and complete male sterility. During late anther development, mads3-4 exhibits oxidative stress-related phenotypes. Microarray analysis revealed expression level changes in many genes in mads3-4 anthers. Some of these genes encode proteins involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis; among them is MT-1-4b, which encodes a type 1 small Cys-rich and metal binding protein. In vivo and in vitro assays showed that MADS3 is associated with the promoter of MT-1-4b, and recombinant MT-1-4b has superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. Reducing the expression of MT-1-4b causes decreased pollen fertility and an increased level of superoxide anion in transgenic plants. Our findings suggest that MADS3 is a key transcriptional regulator that functions in rice male reproductive development, at least in part, by modulating ROS levels through MT-1-4b.
Plant Cell-2011-Li-2536-52.pdf	Rice MADS6 interacts with the floral homeotic genes SUPERWOMAN1, MADS3, MADS58, MADS13, and DROOPING LEAF in specifying floral organ identities and meristem fate	2011	Plant Cell	Institute of Plant Science, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6) genes play essential roles in flower development, but whether and how they work with floral organ identity genes remain less understood. Here, we describe interactions of the rice (Oryza sativa) AGL6 gene MADS6 with other rice floral homeotic genes in flower development. Genetic analyses revealed that MADS6 specifies the identity of the three inner whorls and floral meristem determinacy redundantly with SUPERWOMAN1/MADS16 (B-gene) or MADS3 (C-gene). MADS6 was shown to define carpel/ovule development and floral determinacy by interacting with MADS13 (D-gene) and control the palea and floral meristem identities together with the YABBY gene DROOPING LEAF. Expression analyses revealed that the transcript levels of six B-, C-, and E-class genes were reduced in mads6-1 at the early flower developmental stage, suggesting that MADS6 is a key regulator of early flower development. Moreover, MADS6 can directly bind to a putative regulatory motif on MADS58 (C-gene), and mads6-1 mads58 displayed phenotypes similar to that of mads6-1. These results suggest that MADS6 is a key player in specifying flower development via interacting with other floral homeotic genes in rice, thus providing new insights into the mechanism by which flower development is controlled.
Plant Cell Physiol-2002-Kyozuka-130-5.pdf	Ectopic Expression of OsMADS3, a Rice Ortholog of AGAMOUS, Caused a Homeotic Transformation of Lodicules to Stamens in Transgenic Rice Plants	2002	Plant and Cell Physiology	Laboratory for Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5, Takayama, Ikoma, 630-0101 Japan	In order to clarify the evolutionary relationship of floral organs between grasses and dicots, we expressed OsMADS3, a rice (Oryza sativa L.) AGAMOUS(AG) ortholog, in rice plants under the control of an Actin1 promoter. As a consequence of the ectopic expression of the OsMADS3, lodicules were homeotically transformed into stamens. In total, the transformation of lodicules to staminoid organs was observed in 18 out of 26 independent transgenic lines. In contrast to the almost complete transformation occurring in lodicules, none of the transgenic plants exhibited any morphological alterations in the palea or the lemma. Our results confirmed the prediction that the lodicule is an equivalent of a dicot petal and that the ABC model can be applied to rice at least for organ specification in lodicules and stamens.
NA	Loss of function of OsMADS3 via the insertion of a novel retrotransposon leads to recessive male sterility in rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	Plant Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Natural mutation is the source of natural variation, which is the fundamental basis for the genetic improvement of crops. During the process of developing a recombinant inbred line (RI), a spontaneous mutagenesis in RI127 led to the production of the recessive male-sterile line RI127S. Via a map-based cloning approach, the gene controlling the male sterility was identified as OsMADS3, which was previously reported to be associated with floral organ development and male sterility. Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR isolated one 1633-bp insertion in OsMADS3 in RI127S, which damaged its function due to failed transcription. The 1633-bp insertion was derived from a fragment flanked by retrotransposon genes on chromosome 5. Seven haplotypes of OsMADS3 were observed among 529 cultivars and 107 wild rice accessions, and 98% of the investigated genotypes carried the same H2 haplotype, indicating that OsMADS3 is highly conserved. RI127S has the combined genome constitution of its parents, indica rice Teqing and japonica 02428, and carries the widely compatible S5 gene donated by 02428. RI127 exhibits good performance in regard to its agronomic traits and has a wide compatibility. Therefore, RI127S would be an elite mediator for recurrent breeding in cases requiring a tedious hand-crossing-based inter-crossing phase. RI127S can be crossed not only with indica rice but also with japonica rice, thus providing breeders with flexible arrangements in recurrent breeding programs.
NA	Genetic Enhancer Analysis Reveals that FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 and OsMADS3 Cooperatively Regulate Maintenance and Determinacy of the Flower Meristem in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biological Sciences, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 113-8654 Tokyo, Japan.	Meristems such as the shoot apical meristem and flower meristem (FM) act as a reservoir of stem cells, which reproduce themselves and supply daughter cells for the differentiation of lateral organs. In Oryza sativa (rice), FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) gene, which is similar to Arabidopsis CLAVATA3, is involved in meristem maintenance. In fon2 mutants, the numbers of floral organs are increased due to an enlargement of the FM. To identify new factors regulating meristem maintenance in rice, we performed a genetic screening of mutants that enhanced the fon2 mutation, and found a mutant line (2B-424) in which pistil number was dramatically increased. By using a map-based approach and next-generation sequencing, we found that the line 2B-424 had a complete loss-of-function mutation (a large deletion) in OsMADS3, a class C MADS-box gene that is known to be involved in stamen specification. Disruption of OsMADS3 in the fon2 mutant by CRISPR-Cas9 technology caused a flower phenotype similar to that of 2B-424, confirming that the gene responsible for enhancement of fon2 was OsMADS3. Morphological analysis showed that the fon2 and osmads3 mutations synergistically affected pistil development and FM determinacy. We also found that whorl 3 was duplicated in mature flowers and the FM was enlarged at an early developmental stage in severe osmads3 single mutants. These findings suggest that OsMADS3 is involved not only in FM determinacy in late flower development but also in FM activity in early flower development.
NA	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation	2021	Chemosphere .	Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Cadmium (Cd) is a biologically non-essential and toxic heavy metal leaking to the environment via natural emission or anthropogenic activities, thereby contaminating crops and threatening human health. Metallothioneins (MTs) are a group of metal-binding proteins playing critical roles in metal allocation and homeostasis. In this study, we identified a novel function of OsMT1e from rice plants. OsMT1e was dominantly expressed in roots at all developmental stages and, to less extent, expressed in leaves at vegetative and seed filling stages. OsMT1e was mainly targeted to the nucleus and substantially induced by Cd exposure. Expression of OsMT1e in a yeast Cd-sensitive strain ycf1 conferred cellular tolerance to Cd, even though the ycf1 + OsMT1e cells accumulated more Cd than the control cells (ycf1 + pYES2). Both transgenic rice overexpressing (OX) and repressing OsMT1e by RNA interference (RNAi) were developed. Phenotypic analysis revealed that OsMT1e overexpression enhanced the rice growth concerning the increased shoot or root elongation, dry weight and chlorophyll contents, whereas the RNAi lines displayed a sensitive growth phenotype compared to wild-type. Assessment with 0.5, 2 and 10 ¦ÌM Cd for two weeks revealed that the RNAi lines accumulated less Cd, while the OX lines had an increased Cd accumulation in root and shoot tissues. The contrasting Cd accumulation phenotypes between the OX and RNAi lines were further confirmed by a long-term study with 0.5 ¦ÌM Cd for one month. Overall, the study unveiled a new function of OsMT1e in rice, which can be potentially used for engineering genotypes for phytoremediation or minimizing Cd in rice crops.
