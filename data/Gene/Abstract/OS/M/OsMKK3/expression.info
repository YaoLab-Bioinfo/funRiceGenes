OsMKK3	 It was observed that mechanical wounding, infestation of brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, and treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or salicylic acid (SA) could induce the expression of OsMKK3 |  The over-expression of OsMKK3 (oe-MKK3) increased levels of jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and abscisic acid (ABA), and decreased SA levels in rice after BPH attack |  Additionally, the preference for feeding and oviposition, the hatching rate of BPH eggs, and BPH nymph survival rate were significantly compromised due to over-expression of OsMKK3
