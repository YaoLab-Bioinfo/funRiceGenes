OsMFT2	 OsMFT2 knock-out lines exhibited pre-harvest sprouting, while OsMFT2 overexpression lines showed delayed germination |  RNA expression profiling showed that OsMFT2 was specifically expressed in seeds |  Performance of transgenic plants demonstrated that overexpressing OsbZIP23 rescued the pre-harvest sprouting phenotype and expression decrease of ABA signaling genes caused by OsMFT2 knocking-out	 OsMFT2 knock-out lines exhibited pre-harvest sprouting, while OsMFT2 overexpression lines showed delayed germination
