Osmyb3|SG3	Osmyb5	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined
Osmyb3|SG3	Osmyb5	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	Another myb-like clone, Osmyb5, was obtained by screening a rice seed cDNA library with probes designed to recognize the AACA-like binding domain in GAMYB and PHMYB3
Osmyb3|SG3	Osmyb5	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	As Osmyb5 exhibits a high similarity to the regions in both GAMYB and PHMYB3, which can bind to the AACA motif, there is a possibility that the OSMYB5 protein may bind to the AACA motif of glutelin genes
Osmyb2	Osmyb3|SG3	Cloning and expression of five myb-related genes from rice seed	RT-PCR analysis showed that Osmyb2, Osmyb3 and Osmyb5 genes were expressed in all tissues examined
