OsXIP	riceXIP	Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice	Rice XIP-family genes, OsXIP, riceXIP and RIXI, showed differential organ-specific expression
OsXIP	riceXIP	Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice	The transcripts of OsXIP and riceXIP were undetectable under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in the root
OsXIP	RIXI|C10701	Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice	Rice XIP-family genes, OsXIP, riceXIP and RIXI, showed differential organ-specific expression
OsbHLH59|OsbHLH059	OsXIP	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	 Using yeast one-hybrid screening, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a basic helix-loop-helix protein (OsbHLH59) and an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor OsERF71 directly binding to the 562<U+00A0>bp key sequence to activate the expression of OsXIP were identified, which is further supported by transient expression assay
OsERF71	OsXIP	Identification of two transcription factors activating the expression of OsXIP in rice defence response.	 Using yeast one-hybrid screening, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a basic helix-loop-helix protein (OsbHLH59) and an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) transcription factor OsERF71 directly binding to the 562<U+00A0>bp key sequence to activate the expression of OsXIP were identified, which is further supported by transient expression assay
