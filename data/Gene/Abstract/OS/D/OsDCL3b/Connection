OsDCL3a	OsDCL3b	Roles of DCL4 and DCL3b in rice phased small RNA biogenesis	Surprisingly, the processing of 24-nucleotide phased small RNA requires the DCL3 homolog OsDCL3b rather than OsDCL3a, suggesting functional divergence within DCL3 family
OsDCL3b	SHO1|OsDCL4	Roles of DCL4 and DCL3b in rice phased small RNA biogenesis	Our results revealed significant roles of OsDCL4, OsDCL3b and OsDCL1 in the 21- and 24-nucleotide phased small RNA biogenesis pathway in rice
