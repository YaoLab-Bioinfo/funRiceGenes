OsDCL1a	SHO1|OsDCL4	Roles of DCL4 and DCL3b in rice phased small RNA biogenesis	Our results revealed significant roles of OsDCL4, OsDCL3b and OsDCL1 in the 21- and 24-nucleotide phased small RNA biogenesis pathway in rice

OsDCL1a	SHO1|OsDCL4	Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice	An RNA interference approach was applied to knock down two OsDCLs, OsDCL1 and OsDCL4, respectively
OsDCL1a	SHO1|OsDCL4	Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice	Moreover, all miRNAs tested were greatly reduced in OsDCL1IR but not OsDCL4IR transformants, indicating that OsDCL1 plays a critical role in miRNA processing in rice
OsDCL1a	SHO1|OsDCL4	Loss of function of OsDCL1 affects microRNA accumulation and causes developmental defects in rice	In contrast, the production of siRNA from transgenic inverted repeats and endogenous CentO regions were not affected in either OsDCL1IR or OsDCL4IR transformants, suggesting that the production of miRNAs and siRNAs is via distinct OsDCLs
