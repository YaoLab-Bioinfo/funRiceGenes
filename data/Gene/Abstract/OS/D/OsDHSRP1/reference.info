Plants are sessile and unable to avoid environmental stresses, such as drought, high temperature, and high salinity, which often limit the overall plant growth. Plants have evolved many complex mechanisms to survive these abiotic stresses via post-translational modifications. Recent evidence suggests that ubiquitination plays a crucial role in regulating abiotic stress responses in plants by regulating their substrate proteins. Here, we reported the molecular function of a RING finger E3 ligase, Oryza sativa Drought, Heat and Salt-induced RING finger protein 1 (OsDHSRP1), involved in regulating plant abiotic stress tolerance via the Ub/26S proteasome system. The OsDHSRP1 gene transcripts were highly expressed under various abiotic stresses such as NaCl, drought, and heat and the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). In addition, in vitro ubiquitination assays demonstrated that the OsDHSRP1 protein possesses a RING-H2 type domain that confers ligase functionality. The results of yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), in vitro pull-down, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays support that OsDHSRP1 is able to regulate two substrates, O. sativa glyoxalase (OsGLYI-11.2) and O. sativa abiotic stress-induced cysteine proteinase 1 (OsACP1). We further confirmed that these two substrate proteins were ubiquitinated by OsDHSRP1 E3 ligase and caused protein degradation via the Ub/26S proteasome system. The Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsDHSRP1 exhibited hypersensitivity to drought, heat, and NaCl stress and a decrease in their germination rates and root lengths compared to the control plants because the degradation of the OsGLYI-11.2 protein maintained lower glyoxalase levels, which increased the methylglyoxal amount in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. However, the OsDHSRP1-overexpressing plants showed no significant difference when treated with ABA. Our finding supports the hypothesis that the OsDHSRP1 E3 ligase acts as a negative regulator, and the degradation of its substrate proteins via ubiquitination plays important roles in regulating various abiotic stress responses via an ABA-independent pathway.
