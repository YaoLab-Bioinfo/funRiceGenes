OsDMC1|DMC1B	sterility	OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa	The OsDMC1-RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility
OsDMC1|DMC1B	sterility	OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa	The sterility phenotypes were associated with down-regulated OsDMC1 transcript and protein levels mediated by RNAi
OsDMC1|DMC1B	root	Isolation and characterization of OsDMC1 , the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene essential for meiosis	OsDMC1 was expressed at high-levels in reproductive organs, low-levels in roots, and undetectable levels in leaves and seedlings
OsDMC1|DMC1B	pollen	OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa	The OsDMC1-RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility
OsDMC1|DMC1B	spikelet	OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa	The OsDMC1-RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility
OsDMC1|DMC1B	meiosis	Isolation and characterization of OsDMC1 , the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene essential for meiosis	Isolation and characterization of OsDMC1 , the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene essential for meiosis
OsDMC1|DMC1B	reproductive	Isolation and characterization of OsDMC1 , the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene essential for meiosis	OsDMC1 was expressed at high-levels in reproductive organs, low-levels in roots, and undetectable levels in leaves and seedlings
OsDMC1|DMC1B	meiotic	OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa	Further cytological observations of male meiocytes revealed that knock-down of OsDMC1 led to defects in bivalent formation and subsequent unequal chromosome segregation and irregular spore generation, and induced changes in male meiotic progression
OsDMC1|DMC1B	vegetative	OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa	The OsDMC1-RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility
OsDMC1|DMC1B	meiotic	DNA strand exchange activity of rice recombinase OsDmc1 monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and the role of ATP hydrolysis	DNA binding and pairing activities of Oryza sativa disrupted meiotic cDNA1 (OsDmc1) from rice have been reported earlier
OsDMC1|DMC1B	anther	DNA binding and pairing activity of OsDmc1, a recombinase from rice	A cloned cDNA corresponding to OsDMC1 from rice anther tissue was expressed in Escherichia coli
OsDMC1|DMC1B	meiosis	OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa	Here, we analyzed the function of OsDMC1 in meiosis using an RNA interference approach
OsDMC1|DMC1B	meiosis	OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa	These data indicate that OsDMC1 is essential for rice meiosis and plays an important role in homologous pairing
OsDMC1|DMC1B	seedling	Isolation and characterization of OsDMC1 , the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene essential for meiosis	OsDMC1 was expressed at high-levels in reproductive organs, low-levels in roots, and undetectable levels in leaves and seedlings
OsDMC1|DMC1B	meiosis	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	These biochemical differences between the DMC1A and DMC1B proteins may provide important insight into their functional differences during meiosis in rice
OsDMC1|DMC1B	meiotic	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	Moreover, OsDMC1 was not detected in pairing-defective mutants, such as pair2, pair3, Oscom1 and Osrad51c, while it was loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in zep1, Osmer3, Oszip4 and Oshei10
OsDMC1|DMC1B	crossover	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	The reduced number of bivalents and abnormal OsHEI10 foci in Osdmc1a Osdmc1b establishes an essential role for OsDMC1 in crossover formation
OsDMC1|DMC1B	meiosis	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	 These results indicate that OsBRCA2 is essential for facilitating the loading of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 onto resected ends of programmed double-strand breaks (DSB) during meiosis to promote single-end invasions of homologous chromosomes and accurate recombination
OsDMC1|DMC1B	meiotic	Rice OsBRCA2 Is Required for DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Meiotic Cells	 In the absence of OsBRCA2, localization to the meiotic chromosome axes of the strand-invasion proteins OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 is severely reduced and in vitro OsBRCA2 directly interacts with OsRAD51 and OsDMC1
