DMC1A|DMC1	OsDMC1|DMC1B	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	Although the Oryza sativa DMC1A protein has been partially characterized, however the biochemical properties of the DMC1B protein have not been defined

DMC1A|DMC1	OsDMC1|DMC1B	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	The purified DMC1A and DMC1B proteins formed helical filaments along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and promoted robust strand exchange between ssDNA and dsDNA over five thousand base pairs in the presence of RPA, as a co-factor
DMC1A|DMC1	OsDMC1|DMC1B	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	The DMC1A and DMC1B proteins also promoted strand exchange in the absence of RPA with long DNA substrates containing several thousand base pairs

DMC1A|DMC1	OsDMC1|DMC1B	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	Taken together, these results suggest that during meiosis, OsDMC1 is dispensable for homologous pairing in rice, which is quite different from the DMC1 homologs identified so far in other organisms
OsCOM1	OsDMC1|DMC1B	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	In the absence of OsDMC1, early recombination events probably occur normally, leading to normal localization of γH2AX, PAIR3, OsMRE11, OsCOM1 and OsRAD51C
OsCOM1	OsDMC1|DMC1B	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	Moreover, OsDMC1 was not detected in pairing-defective mutants, such as pair2, pair3, Oscom1 and Osrad51c, while it was loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in zep1, Osmer3, Oszip4 and Oshei10
OsDMC1|DMC1B	OsMRE11	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	In the absence of OsDMC1, early recombination events probably occur normally, leading to normal localization of γH2AX, PAIR3, OsMRE11, OsCOM1 and OsRAD51C
OsDMC1|DMC1B	OsZIP4	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	Moreover, OsDMC1 was not detected in pairing-defective mutants, such as pair2, pair3, Oscom1 and Osrad51c, while it was loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in zep1, Osmer3, Oszip4 and Oshei10

OsDMC1|DMC1B	ZEP1	OsDMC1 is not required for homologous pairing in rice meiosis.	Moreover, OsDMC1 was not detected in pairing-defective mutants, such as pair2, pair3, Oscom1 and Osrad51c, while it was loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in zep1, Osmer3, Oszip4 and Oshei10
OsDMC1|DMC1B	OsFIGNL1	The Rice AAA-ATPase OsFIGNL1 Is Essential for Male Meiosis.	 Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated OsFIGNL1 could interact with RAD51A1, RAD51A2, DMC1A, DMC1B, and these physical interactions were further confirmed by BiFC assay
OsDMC1|DMC1B	OsRAD51D	OsRAD51D promotes homologous pairing and recombination by preventing non-homologous interactions in rice meiosis.	 The failed localization of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 in Osrad51d, together with the genetic analysis of Osrad51d Osdmc1a Osdmc1b, indicates that OsRAD51D acts at a very early stage of HR
OsATM	OsDMC1|DMC1B	OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.	 Aberrant chromosome associations disappeared in Osspo11-1 Osatm-1 double mutants and more severe defects were observed in Osdmc1  Osatm, suggesting that OsATM functions downstream of OsSPO11-1-catalyzed double-strand break (DSB) formation and in parallel with OsDMC1-mediated homologous recombination
OsATM	OsDMC1|DMC1B	OsATM safeguards accurate repair of meiotic double-strand breaks in rice.	 Moreover, the removal of OsDMC1 from chromosomes in Osatm PMCs was delayed and the number of HEI10 foci (markers of interference-sensitive CO intermediates) decreased
