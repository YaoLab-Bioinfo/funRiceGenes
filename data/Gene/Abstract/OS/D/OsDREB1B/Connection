OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsDREB1B	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses
OsDREB1B	OsDREB2A	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	In rice, we isolated five cDNAs for DREB homologs: OsDREB1A, OsDREB1B, OsDREB1C, OsDREB1D, and OsDREB2A

OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsDREB1B	Allele mining across DREB1A and DREB1B in diverse rice genotypes suggest a highly conserved pathway inducible by low temperature.	In order to understand whether natural genetic variation in these two loci leads to cold tolerance or susceptibility, OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B were targeted across several rice genotypes showing differential response to low temperature
OsDREB1B	OsPIL14|OsPIF14	Rice phytochrome-interacting factor protein OsPIF14 represses OsDREB1B gene expression through an extended N-box and interacts preferentially with the active form of Phytochrome B.	Rice phytochrome-interacting factor protein OsPIF14 represses OsDREB1B gene expression through an extended N-box and interacts preferentially with the active form of Phytochrome B.
OsDREB1B	OsPIL14|OsPIF14	Rice phytochrome-interacting factor protein OsPIF14 represses OsDREB1B gene expression through an extended N-box and interacts preferentially with the active form of Phytochrome B.	Using a Yeast one Hybrid screening, we identified a putative Phytochrome-Interacting bHLH Factor (OsPIF14), as binding to the OsDREB1B promoter
OsDREB1B	OsPIL14|OsPIF14	Rice phytochrome-interacting factor protein OsPIF14 represses OsDREB1B gene expression through an extended N-box and interacts preferentially with the active form of Phytochrome B.	We have shown that OsPIF14 binds to the OsDREB1B promoter through two N-boxes and that the flanking regions of the hexameric core are essential for protein-DNA interaction and stability
OsDREB1B	OsPIL14|OsPIF14	Rice phytochrome-interacting factor protein OsPIF14 represses OsDREB1B gene expression through an extended N-box and interacts preferentially with the active form of Phytochrome B.	We also showed that OsPIF14 down-regulates OsDREB1B gene expression in rice protoplasts, corroborating the OsPIF14 repressor activity observed in the transactivation assays using Arabidopsis protoplasts
OsDREB1B	OsPIL14|OsPIF14	Rice phytochrome-interacting factor protein OsPIF14 represses OsDREB1B gene expression through an extended N-box and interacts preferentially with the active form of Phytochrome B.	All together, these results suggest the possibility that OsPIF14 is involved in cross-talk between light and stress signaling through interaction with the OsDREB1B promoter
OsDREB1B	OsPIL14|OsPIF14	Rice phytochrome-interacting factor protein OsPIF14 represses OsDREB1B gene expression through an extended N-box and interacts preferentially with the active form of Phytochrome B.	Although in the absence of stress, OsDREB1B gene expression was not regulated by light, given previous reports, it remains possible that OsPIF14 has a role in light modulation of stress responses
APG|OsPIL16	OsDREB1B	Phytochrome B Negatively Affects Cold Tolerance by Regulating OsDREB1 Gene Expression through Phytochrome Interacting Factor-Like Protein OsPIL16 in Rice.	Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assay revealed that OsPIL16 can bind to the N-box region of OsDREB1B promoter
OsDREB1B	OsULT1	Rice Trithorax factor ULTRAPETALA 1 (OsULT1) specifically binds to &quot;GAGAG&quot; sequence motif present in Polycomb response elements.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicates cold induced enrichment of OsULT1 occupancy and a decrease in H3K27me3 mark in the promoter region of OsDREB1b gene, during transcription activation
OsDREB1B	OsULT1	Rice Trithorax factor ULTRAPETALA 1 (OsULT1) specifically binds to &quot;GAGAG&quot; sequence motif present in Polycomb response elements.	 Thus, binding of OsULT1 to GAGAG motif, along with a decrease in H3K27me3 suggests that OsULT1 antagonises the repressive effect of PcG complex for transcriptional activation of OsDREB1b
