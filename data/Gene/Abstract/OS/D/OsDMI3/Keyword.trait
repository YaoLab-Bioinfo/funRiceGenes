OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	root	A rice gene for microbial symbiosis, Oryza sativa CCaMK, reduces CH4 flux in a paddy field with low nitrogen input	Although Oryza sativa CCaMK (OsCCaMK) is required for fungal accommodation in rice roots, little is known about the role of OsCCaMK in rice symbiosis with bacteria
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	root	A rice gene for microbial symbiosis, Oryza sativa CCaMK, reduces CH4 flux in a paddy field with low nitrogen input	Thus, CH4 oxidation and N2 fixation were simultaneously activated in the root zone of WT rice in the LN field and both processes are likely controlled by OsCCaMK

OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	 ABA 	OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice	Our data indicate that there exists a cross-talk between OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in ABA signalling, in which OsDMI3 functions upstream of OsMPK1 to regulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 in rice
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	oxidative	OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice	Further, the oxidative damage induced by higher concentrations of PEG and H(2)O(2) was aggravated in the mutant of OsDMI3
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	ethylene	OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice	Treatments with ABA, H(2)O(2), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) induced the expression of OsDMI3 and the activity of OsDMI3, and H(2)O(2) is required for the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsDMI3 under water stress
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	nitrogen	A rice gene for microbial symbiosis, Oryza sativa CCaMK, reduces CH4 flux in a paddy field with low nitrogen input	Here, we report the effect of a Tos17-induced OsCCaMK mutant (NE1115) on CH4 flux in low-nitrogen (LN) and standard-nitrogen (SN) paddy fields compared with wild-type (WT) Nipponbare
OsCCaMK|OsDMI3	 ABA 	OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice	Moreover, the analysis of the RNAi silencing of OsDMI3 in protoplasts and the mutant of OsDMI3 showed that higher levels of H(2)O(2) accumulation require OsDMI3 activation in ABA signaling, but the initial H(2)O(2) production induced by ABA is not dependent on the activation of OsDMI3 in leaves of rice plants
