OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	salt	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	salt	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	Over-expression of OsDREB1A in transgenic Arabidopsis induced over-expression of target stress-inducible genes of Arabidopsis DREB1A resulting in plants with higher tolerance to drought, high-salt, and freezing stresses
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	salt	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	OsDREB1A is potentially useful for producing transgenic monocots that are tolerant to drought, high-salt, and/or cold stresses

OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	drought	ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Comparative time-course expression analysis indicated that ENAC1 expression, similar with OsDREB1A, was induced very quickly by various abiotic stresses including salt, drought, cold, and exogenous abscisic acid
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	drought	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	Over-expression of OsDREB1A in transgenic Arabidopsis induced over-expression of target stress-inducible genes of Arabidopsis DREB1A resulting in plants with higher tolerance to drought, high-salt, and freezing stresses
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	drought	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	OsDREB1A is potentially useful for producing transgenic monocots that are tolerant to drought, high-salt, and/or cold stresses
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	salt	ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)

OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	transcription factor	An AP2/EREBP-type transcription-factor gene from rice is cold-inducible and encodes a nuclear-localized protein	These results suggested that OsDREBL may function as a transcription factor in the cold-stress response, independent of the DREB signal-transduction pathway
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	abiotic stress	ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)

OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	abiotic stress	ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	However, the induction of ENAC1 by abiotic stress was transient and lasted up to 3 h, whereas that of OsDREB1A maintained longer
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	cold stress	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	OsDREB1A is potentially useful for producing transgenic monocots that are tolerant to drought, high-salt, and/or cold stresses
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	salt stress	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses

OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	temperature	Allele mining across DREB1A and DREB1B in diverse rice genotypes suggest a highly conserved pathway inducible by low temperature.	In order to understand whether natural genetic variation in these two loci leads to cold tolerance or susceptibility, OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B were targeted across several rice genotypes showing differential response to low temperature
