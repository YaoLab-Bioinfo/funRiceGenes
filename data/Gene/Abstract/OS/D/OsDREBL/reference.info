First, a 1.5 kb-long promoter region of OsDhn1 was isolated and characterized by Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis. GUS assay of OsDhn1::gus plants showed that the GUS activity in the leaves was induced by drought stress but not by wound, cold, salt, or ABA treatment. Second, transactivation assay revealed that OsDhn1 promoter is activated by OsDREB1A or OsDREB1D as well as CBF1 but not by OsDREB1B or OsDREB1C. Taken together, these suggest that the drought-inducible OsDhn1 gene is regulated by abiotic stress signaling pathway involving CBF/DREB.
j.1365-313X.2003.01661.x.pdf	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	2003	The Plant Journal	Biological Resources Division, Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences (JIRCAS), 1-1 Ohwashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8686, Japan.	The transcription factors DREBs/CBFs specifically interact with the dehydration-responsive element/C-repeat (DRE/CRT) cis-acting element (core motif: G/ACCGAC) and control the expression of many stress-inducible genes in Arabidopsis. In rice, we isolated five cDNAs for DREB homologs: OsDREB1A, OsDREB1B, OsDREB1C, OsDREB1D, and OsDREB2A. Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses. The OsDREB1A and OsDREB2A proteins specifically bound to DRE and activated the transcription of the GUS reporter gene driven by DRE in rice protoplasts. Over-expression of OsDREB1A in transgenic Arabidopsis induced over-expression of target stress-inducible genes of Arabidopsis DREB1A resulting in plants with higher tolerance to drought, high-salt, and freezing stresses. This indicated that OsDREB1A has functional similarity to DREB1A. However, in microarray and RNA blot analyses, some stress-inducible target genes of the DREB1A proteins that have only ACCGAC as DRE were not over-expressed in the OsDREB1A transgenic Arabidopsis. The OsDREB1A protein bound to GCCGAC more preferentially than to ACCGAC whereas the DREB1A proteins bound to both GCCGAC and ACCGAC efficiently. The structures of DREB1-type ERF/AP2 domains in monocots are closely related to each other as compared with that in the dicots. OsDREB1A is potentially useful for producing transgenic monocots that are tolerant to drought, high-salt, and/or cold stresses.
pone.0047275.pdf	Colinearity and similar expression pattern of rice DREB1s reveal their functional conservation in the cold-responsive pathway	2012	PLoS One	Key Laboratory of Agro-Ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changsha, China.	The clustered genes C-repeat (CRT) binding factor (CBF)1/dehydration-responsive element binding protein (DREB)1B, CBF2/DREB1C, and CBF3/DREB1A play a central role in cold acclimation and facilitate plant resistance to freezing in Arabidopsis thaliana. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is very sensitive to low temperatures; enhancing the cold stress tolerance of rice is a key challenge to increasing its yield. In this study, we demonstrate chilling acclimation, a phenomenon similar to Arabidopsis cold acclimation, in rice. To determine whether rice CBF/DREB1 genes participate in this cold-responsive pathway, all putative homologs of Arabidopsis DREB1 genes were filtered from the complete rice genome through a BLASTP search, followed by phylogenetic, colinearity and expression analysis. We thereby identified 10 rice genes as putative DREB1 homologs: nine of these were located in rice genomic regions with some colinearity to the Arabidopsis CBF1-CBF4 region. Expression profiling revealed that six of these genes (Os01g73770, Os02g45450, Os04g48350, Os06g03670, Os09g35010, and Os09g35030) were similarly expressed in response to chilling acclimation and cold stress and were co-expressed with genes involved in cold signalling, suggesting that these DREB1 homologs may be involved in the cold response in rice. The results presented here serve as a prelude towards understanding the function of rice homologs of DREB1 genes in cold-sensitive crops.
s00122-003-1346-5.pdf	An AP2/EREBP-type transcription-factor gene from rice is cold-inducible and encodes a nuclear-localized protein	2003	TAG Theoretical and Applied Genetics	Plant Biotechnology Laboratory, Institute of Genetics and Development Biology, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	We cloned an AP2/EREBP gene by dot blotting and named it OsDREBL. Analysis of its deduced amino-acid sequence indicated that this protein had a potential nuclear-localization signal, a possible acidic-activation domain and an AP2 DNA binding domain. Northern analysis showed that the transcripts of OsDREBL accumulated rapidly (within 30 min) in response to low temperature, but not in response to ABA, NaCl and dehydration treatments. Southern analysis indicated the presence of a single-copy of the OsDREBL gene in the Oryza sativa genome. Our research also demonstrated that OsDREBL was localized to the nucleus but did not bind effectively to the C-repeat/dehydration responsive element (CRT/DRE). These results suggested that OsDREBL may function as a transcription factor in the cold-stress response, independent of the DREB signal-transduction pathway.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs12033-011-9477-4.pdf	ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2012	Mol Biotechnol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	The plant-specific NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC)-domain proteins play important roles in plant development and stress responses. In this research, a full-length cDNA named ENAC1 (early NAC-domain protein induced by abiotic stress 1) was isolated from rice. ENAC1 possess one NAC domain in the N-terminus. Comparative time-course expression analysis indicated that ENAC1 expression, similar with OsDREB1A, was induced very quickly by various abiotic stresses including salt, drought, cold, and exogenous abscisic acid. However, the induction of ENAC1 by abiotic stress was transient and lasted up to 3 h, whereas that of OsDREB1A maintained longer. The promoter sequence of ENAC1 harbors several cis-elements including ABA response elements, but the well-known dehydration responsive element/C-repeat element is absent. The ENAC1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of rice protoplast cell. Yeast hybrid assays revealed that ENAC1 was a transcription activator and bound to NAC recognition sequence (NACRS). Co-expression analysis suggested that ENAC1 co-expressed with a number of stress-related genes. Taken together, ENAC1 may be an early transcription activator of stress responses and function in the regulation of NACRS-mediated gene expression under abiotic stress.
NA	Allele mining across DREB1A and DREB1B in diverse rice genotypes suggest a highly conserved pathway inducible by low temperature.	2015	J Genet	School of Crop Improvement, College of Post Graduate Studies, Central Agricultural University, Umroi Road, Umiam 793 103, India. wtyagi.cau@gmail.com.	Low temperature stress is one of the major limiting factors affecting rice productivity in higher altitudes. DREB1A and DREB1B, are two transcription factors that have been reported to play key regulatory role in low temperature tolerance. In order to understand whether natural genetic variation in these two loci leads to cold tolerance or susceptibility, OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B were targeted across several rice genotypes showing differential response to low temperature. Expression data suggests induction of gene expression in shoots in response to low temperature in both tolerant and susceptible genotypes. Upon sequence analysis of 20 rice genotypes, eight nucleotide changes were identified including two in the coding region and six in the 5'UTR. None of the discovered novel variations lie in the conserved region of the genes under study, thereby causing little or no changes in putative function of the corresponding proteins. In silico analysis using a diverse set of 400 O. sativa revealed much lower nucleotide diversity estimates across two DREB loci and one other gene (MYB2) involved in DREB pathway than those observed for other rice genes. None of the changes showed association with seedling stage cold tolerance, suggesting that nucleotide changes in DREB loci are unlikely to contribute to low temperature tolerance. So far, data concerning the physiological role and regulation of DREB1 in different genetic background are very limited; it is to be expected that they will be studied extensively in the near future.
NA	Double overexpression of DREB and PIF transcription factors improves drought stress tolerance and cell elongation in transgenic plants.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.	Although a variety of transgenic plants that are tolerant to drought stress have been generated, many of these plants show growth retardation. To improve drought tolerance and plant growth, we applied a gene-stacking approach using two transcription factor genes: DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING 1A (DREB1A) and rice PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE 1 (OsPIL1). The overexpression of DREB1A has been reported to improve drought stress tolerance in various crops, although it also causes a severe dwarf phenotype. OsPIL1 is a rice homologue of Arabidopsis PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), and it enhances cell elongation by activating cell wall-related gene expression. We found that the OsPIL1 protein was more stable than PIF4 under light conditions in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Transactivation analyses revealed that DREB1A and OsPIL1 did not negatively affect each other's transcriptional activities. The transgenic plants overexpressing both OsPIL1 and DREB1A showed improved drought stress tolerance similar to that of DREB1A overexpressors. Furthermore, double overexpressors showed enhanced hypocotyl elongation and floral induction compared with the DREB1A overexpressors. Metabolome analyses indicated that compatible solutes, such as sugars and amino acids, accumulated in the double overexpressors, which was similar to the observations of the DREB1A overexpressors. Transcriptome analyses showed increased expression of abiotic stress-inducible DREB1A downstream genes and cell elongation-related OsPIL1 downstream genes in the double overexpressors, which suggests that these two transcription factors function independently in the transgenic plants despite the trade-offs required to balance plant growth and stress tolerance. Our study provides a basis for plant genetic engineering designed to overcome growth retardation in drought-tolerant transgenic plants. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	Computational characterization of structural and functional roles of DREB1A, DREB1B and DREB1C in enhancing cold tolerance in rice plant.	2019	Amino Acids	ICAR-National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, Odisha, 753 006, India.	Rice serves as the major food for almost half of the world population. Because of its origin in the tropical and subtropical area, rice is more sensitive towards cold stress. Three homologs of DREB1, namely DREB1A, DREB1B and DREB1C are induced Queryduring cold stress and after binding with GCC-box in the promoter region of the target gene, they enhance cold tolerance in rice plants. Though the majority of DREBs bind GCC-box, the degree of activation varies among DREBs. The protein encoded via these three transcription factors contains a common domain, namely AP2/ERF. In silico method was utilised to predict 3D structure of each AP2/ERF domain. The molecular dynamic analysis suggests, under the normal environmental condition, in each AP2/ERF domain, a positive correlation exists between ¦Â-strands and the movement of C-¦Á is constrained. However, during cold stress, when AP2/ERF domain binds with GCC-box present in the promoter region of the target gene, mean pressure of each three AP2/ERF domain gets lowered and final potential energy increases. A positive correlation between ¦Â-strands gets disrupted and C-¦Á experiences random movement suggesting enhanced activity of DREB1A, DREB1B and DREB1C during cold stress and enhancement of cold tolerance in plants. Further, MM/PBSA calculations for protein-DNA affinities reveal that, due to lack of ¦Á2 in DREB1C, the binding affinity of GCC-box with AP2/ERF domain of DREB1A<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>DREB1B<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>DREB1C. Thus, due to a better binding affinity with GCC-box, DREB1A and DREB1B can be utilised in near future for increasing cold tolerance of rice plant and increasing yield.
NA	Transcriptional Activation and Phosphorylation of OsCNGC9 Confer Enhanced Chilling Tolerance in Rice	2020	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China; National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Low temperature is a major environmental factor limiting plant growth and productivity. Although transient elevation of cytoplasmic calcium has long been recognized as a critical signal for plant cold tolerance, the calcium channels responsible for this process have remained largely elusive. Here, we reported that OsCNGC9, a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, positively regulates chilling tolerance by mediating cytoplasmic calcium elevation in rice (Oryza sativa). We showed that the loss-of-function mutant of OsCNGC9 is defective in cold-induced calcium influx and more sensitive to prolonged cold treatment while OsCNGC9 overexpression confers enhanced cold tolerance. Mechanistically, we showed that in response to chilling stress, OsSAPK8, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana OST1, phosphorylates and activates OsCNGC9 to trigger Ca2+ influx. In addition, transcription of OsCNGC9 is activated by a rice dehydration responsive element binding transcription factor, OsDREB1A. Together, our results suggested that OsCNGC9 enhances chilling tolerance in rice through regulating cold-induced calcium influx and cytoplasmic calcium elevation.
