ENAC1	OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Comparative time-course expression analysis indicated that ENAC1 expression, similar with OsDREB1A, was induced very quickly by various abiotic stresses including salt, drought, cold, and exogenous abscisic acid
ENAC1	OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	ENAC1, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	However, the induction of ENAC1 by abiotic stress was transient and lasted up to 3 h, whereas that of OsDREB1A maintained longer
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsDREB1B	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	In rice, we isolated five cDNAs for DREB homologs: OsDREB1A, OsDREB1B, OsDREB1C, OsDREB1D, and OsDREB2A
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsDREB1B	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsDREB1D	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	In rice, we isolated five cDNAs for DREB homologs: OsDREB1A, OsDREB1B, OsDREB1C, OsDREB1D, and OsDREB2A
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsDREB2A	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	In rice, we isolated five cDNAs for DREB homologs: OsDREB1A, OsDREB1B, OsDREB1C, OsDREB1D, and OsDREB2A
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsDREB2A	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	Expression of OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B was induced by cold, whereas expression of OsDREB2A was induced by dehydration and high-salt stresses
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsDREB2A	OsDREB genes in rice,Oryza sativaL., encode transcription activators that function in drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive gene expression	The OsDREB1A and OsDREB2A proteins specifically bound to DRE and activated the transcription of the GUS reporter gene driven by DRE in rice protoplasts
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsDREB1B	Allele mining across DREB1A and DREB1B in diverse rice genotypes suggest a highly conserved pathway inducible by low temperature.	In order to understand whether natural genetic variation in these two loci leads to cold tolerance or susceptibility, OsDREB1A and OsDREB1B were targeted across several rice genotypes showing differential response to low temperature
OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsJRL	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	Overexpression of OsJRL in rice also enhanced salinity tolerance and increased the expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including three LEA (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) genes (OsLEA19a, OsLEA23 and OsLEA24), three Na(+) transporter genes (OsHKT1;3, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5) and two DREB genes (OsDREB1A and OsDREB2B)
