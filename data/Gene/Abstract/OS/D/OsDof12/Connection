FKF1|OsFKF1	OsDof12|OsCDF1	Rice FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (OsFKF1) promotes flowering independent of photoperiod.	Like Arabidopsis FKF1, which interacts with GI and CDF1, OsFKF1 also interacts with OsGI and OsCDF1 (also termed OsDOF12)
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	OsDof12|OsCDF1	Overexpression of OsDof12 affects plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	Of note, in WT plants the expression of OsDof12 was found up-regulated by BR treatment while in OsDof12 overexpression plants two positive BR signaling regulators, OsBRI1 and OsBZR1, were significantly down-regulated, indicating that OsDof12 may act as a negative BR regulator in rice
