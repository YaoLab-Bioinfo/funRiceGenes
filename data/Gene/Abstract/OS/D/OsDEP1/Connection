DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	Gn1a|OsCKX2	A loss-of-function mutation of rice DENSE PANICLE 1 causes semi-dwarfness and slightly increased number of spikelets	The expression level of OsCKX2 in the shoot apex of Dn1-1 plants is similar to that in the wild type, indicating that OsCKX2 does not contribute to an increased number of spikelets
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGB1	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGB1	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	Furthermore, the results suggested that qPE9-1 negatively regulates the ABA response by suppressing the expression of key transcription factors involved in ABA and stress responses, while RGB1 positively regulates ABA biosynthesis by upregulating NCED gene expression under both normal and drought stress conditions
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGB1	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	Taken together, it is proposed that RGB1 is a positive regulator of the ABA response and drought adaption in rice plants, whereas qPE9-1 is modulated by RGB1 and functions as a negative regulator in the ABA-dependent drought-stress responses
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGG1	Function of heterotrimeric G-protein gamma subunit RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in rice by elevating detoxification of ROS.	In salinity-stressed RGG1 transgenic lines, the transcript levels of RGG2, RGB, RGA, DEP1, and GS3 also increased in addition to RGG1
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	GGC2	A G-protein pathway determines grain size in rice.	 Three G¦Ã proteins, DEP1, GGC2 and GS3, antagonistically regulate grain size
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	GGC2	A G-protein pathway determines grain size in rice.	 DEP1 and GGC2, individually or in combination, increase grain length when in complex with G¦Â
