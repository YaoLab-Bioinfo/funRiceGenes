OsHSD1|LGF1	cuticle	OsHSD1, a Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase, Is Involved in Cuticle Formation and Lipid Homeostasis in Rice	Here we report a wax-deficient rice mutant oshsd1 with reduced epicuticular wax crystals and thicker cuticle membrane
OsHSD1|LGF1	cuticle	OsHSD1, a Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase, Is Involved in Cuticle Formation and Lipid Homeostasis in Rice	Together, our data indicated that OsHSD1 plays a specialized role in cuticle formation and lipid homeostasis, probably by mediating sterol signaling
OsHSD1|LGF1	R protein	OsHSD1, a Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase, Is Involved in Cuticle Formation and Lipid Homeostasis in Rice	Furthermore, OsHSD1 mutation resulted in faster protein degradation, but had no effect on the dehydrogenase activity
