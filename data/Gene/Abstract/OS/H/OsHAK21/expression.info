OsHAK21	 Here, we report a significant inducement of OsHAK21 expression by high salinity treatment, and provide genetic evidence of the involvement of OsHAK21 in rice salt tolerance |  Our analyses of subcellular localizations and expression patterns showed that OsHAK21 was localized in the plasma membrane, and expressed in xylem parenchyma and individual endodermal cells (putative passage cells)
OsHAK21|qSE3	 The expression of qSE3 was significantly up-regulated by salinity stress in germinating seeds
