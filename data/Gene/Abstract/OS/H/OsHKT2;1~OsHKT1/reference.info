7601732a.pdf	Rice OsHKT2;1 transporter mediates large Na+ influx component into K+ -starved roots for growth	2007	EMBO J	Division of Biological Sciences, Cell and Developmental Biology Section, and Center for Molecular Genetics, University of California-San Diego, 9500 Gilman Street, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.	Excessive accumulation of sodium in plants causes toxicity. No mutation that greatly diminishes sodium (Na+) influx into plant roots has been isolated. The OsHKT2;1 (previously named OsHKT1) transporter from rice functions as a relatively Na+-selective transporter in heterologous expression systems, but the in vivo function of OsHKT2;1 remains unknown. Here, we analyzed transposon-insertion rice lines disrupted in OsHKT2;1. Interestingly, three independent oshkt2;1-null alleles exhibited significantly reduced growth compared with wild-type plants under low Na+ and K+ starvation conditions. The mutant alleles accumulated less Na+, but not less K+, in roots and shoots. OsHKT2;1 was mainly expressed in the cortex and endodermis of roots. (22)Na+ tracer influx experiments revealed that Na+ influx into oshkt2;1-null roots was dramatically reduced compared with wild-type plants. A rapid repression of OsHKT2;1-mediated Na+ influx and mRNA reduction were found when wild-type plants were exposed to 30 mM NaCl. These analyses demonstrate that Na+ can enhance growth of rice under K+ starvation conditions, and that OsHKT2;1 is the central transporter for nutritional Na+ uptake into K+-starved rice roots.
J. Exp. Bot.-2006-Kader-4257-68.pdf	Expressions of OsHKT1, OsHKT2, and OsVHA are differentially regulated under NaCl stress in salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars	2006	J Exp Bot	Department of Plant Biology and Forest Genetics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Box 7080, SE 75007 Uppsala, Sweden. abdul.kader@vbsg.slu.se	Under NaCl-dominated salt stress, the key to plant survival is maintaining a low cytosolic Na(+) level or Na(+)/K(+) ratio. The OsHKT1, OsHKT2, and OsVHA transporter genes might play important roles in maintaining cytosolic Na(+) homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L. indica cvs Pokkali and BRRI Dhan29). Upon NaCl stress, the OsHKT1 transcript was significantly down-regulated in salt-tolerant cv. Pokkali, but not in salt-sensitive cv. BRRI Dhan29. NaCl stress induced the expression of OsHKT2 and OsVHA in both Pokkali and BRRI Dhan29. In cv. Pokkali, OsHKT2 and OsVHA transcripts were induced immediately after NaCl stress. However, in cv. BRRI Dhan29, the induction of OsHKT2 was quite low and of OsVHA was low and delayed, compared with that in cv. Pokkali. OsHKT2 and OsVHA induction mostly occurred in the phloem, in the transition from phloem to mesophyll cells, and in the mesophyll cells of the leaves. The vacuolar area in cv. Pokkali did not change under either short- (5-10 min) or long-term (24 h) salt stress, although it significantly increased 24 h after the stress in cv. BRRI Dhan29. When expressional constructs of VHA-c and VHA-a with YFP and CFP were introduced into isolated protoplasts of cvs Pokkali and BRRI Dhan29, the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency between VHA-c and VHA-a upon salt stress decreased slightly in cv. Pokkali, but increased significantly in cv. BRRI Dhan29. The results suggest that the salt-tolerant cv. Pokkali regulates the expression of OsHKT1, OsHKT2, and OsVHA differently from how the salt-sensitive cv. BRRI Dhan29 does. Together, these proteins might confer salt tolerance in Pokkali by maintaining a low cytosolic Na(+) level and a correct ratio of cytosolic Na(+)/K(+).

Na+ uptake in the roots of K+-starved seedlings of barley, rice, and wheat was found to exhibit fast rate, low Km, and high sensitivity to K+. Sunflower plants responded in a similar manner but the uptake was not K+ sensitive. Ba2+ inhibited Na+ uptake, but not K+ uptake in rice roots. This demonstrated that Na+ and K+ uptake are mediated by different transporters, and that K+ blocked but was not transported by the Na+ transporter. The genome of rice cv. Nipponbare contains seven HKT genes, which may encode Na+ transporters, plus two HKT pseudogenes. Yeast expressions of OsHKT1 and OsHKT4 proved that they are Na+ transporters of high and low affinity, respectively, which are sensitive to K+ and Ba2+. Parallel experiments of K+ and Na+ uptake in yeast expressing the wheat or rice HKT1 transporters proved that they were very different; TaHKT1 transported K+ and Na+, and OsHKT1 only Na+. Transcript expressions in shoots of the OsHKT genes were fairly constant and insensitive to changes in the K+ and Na+ concentrations of the nutrient solution. In roots, the expressions were much lower than in shoots, except for OsHKT4 and OsHKT1 in K+-starved plants. We propose that OsHKT transporters are involved in Na+ movements in rice, and that OsHKT1 specifically mediates Na+ uptake in rice roots when the plants are K+ deficient. The incidence of HKT ESTs in several plant species suggests that the rice model with many HKT genes applies to other plants.
j.1365-313X.2012.05031.x.pdf	HKT2;2/1, a K(+)-permeable transporter identified in a salt-tolerant rice cultivar through surveys of natural genetic polymorphism	2012	Plant J	Biochimie et Physiologie Moleculaire des Plantes, Institut de Biologie Integrative des Plantes, UMR 5004 CNRS/UMR 0386 INRA/Montpellier SupAgro/Universite Montpellier 2, 34060 Montpellier Cedex 2, France.	We have investigated OsHKT2;1 natural variation in a collection of 49 cultivars with different levels of salt tolerance and geographical origins. The effect of identified polymorphism on OsHKT2;1 activity was analysed through heterologous expression of variants in Xenopus oocytes. OsHKT2;1 appeared to be a highly conserved protein with only five possible amino acid substitutions that have no substantial effect on functional properties. Our study, however, also identified a new HKT isoform, No-OsHKT2;2/1 in Nona Bokra, a highly salt-tolerant cultivar. No-OsHKT2;2/1 probably originated from a deletion in chromosome 6, producing a chimeric gene. Its 5' region corresponds to that of OsHKT2;2, whose full-length sequence is not present in Nipponbare but has been identified in Pokkali, a salt-tolerant rice cultivar. Its 3' region corresponds to that of OsHKT2;1. No-OsHKT2;2/1 is essentially expressed in roots and displays a significant level of expression at high Na(+) concentrations, in contrast to OsHKT2;1. Expressed in Xenopus oocytes or in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, No-OsHKT2;2/1 exhibited a strong permeability to Na(+) and K(+), even at high external Na(+) concentrations, like OsHKT2;2, and in contrast to OsHKT2;1. Our results suggest that No-OsHKT2;2/1 can contribute to Nona Bokra salt tolerance by enabling root K(+) uptake under saline conditions.
pp1520341.pdf	Differential sodium and potassium transport selectivities of the rice OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2 transporters in plant cells	2010	Plant Physiol	Division of Biological Sciences, Cell and Developmental Biology Section, and Center for Molecular Genetics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0116, USA.	Na(+) and K(+) homeostasis are crucial for plant growth and development. Two HKT transporter/channel classes have been characterized that mediate either Na(+) transport or Na(+) and K(+) transport when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and yeast. However, the Na(+)/K(+) selectivities of the K(+)-permeable HKT transporters have not yet been studied in plant cells. One study expressing 5' untranslated region-modified HKT constructs in yeast has questioned the relevance of cation selectivities found in heterologous systems for selectivity predictions in plant cells. Therefore, here we analyze two highly homologous rice (Oryza sativa) HKT transporters in plant cells, OsHKT2;1 and OsHKT2;2, that show differential K(+) permeabilities in heterologous systems. Upon stable expression in cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Bright-Yellow 2 cells, OsHKT2;1 mediated Na(+) uptake, but little Rb(+) uptake, consistent with earlier studies and new findings presented here in oocytes. In contrast, OsHKT2;2 mediated Na(+)-K(+) cotransport in plant cells such that extracellular K(+) stimulated OsHKT2;2-mediated Na(+) influx and vice versa. Furthermore, at millimolar Na(+) concentrations, OsHKT2;2 mediated Na(+) influx into plant cells without adding extracellular K(+). This study shows that the Na(+)/K(+) selectivities of these HKT transporters in plant cells coincide closely with the selectivities in oocytes and yeast. In addition, the presence of external K(+) and Ca(2+) down-regulated OsHKT2;1-mediated Na(+) influx in two plant systems, Bright-Yellow 2 cells and intact rice roots, and also in Xenopus oocytes. Moreover, OsHKT transporter selectivities in plant cells are shown to depend on the imposed cationic conditions, supporting the model that HKT transporters are multi-ion pores.
NA	OsHKT2;2/1-mediated Na(+) influx over K(+) uptake in roots potentially increases toxic Na(+) accumulation in a salt-tolerant landrace of rice Nona Bokra upon salinity stress.	2015	J Plant Res	Division of Applied Biology, Faculty of Textile Science and Technology, Shinshu University, 3-15-1, Tokida, Ueda, Nagano, 386-8567, Japan.	HKT transporters are Na(+)-permeable membrane proteins, which mediate Na(+) and K(+) homeostasis in K(+)-depleted and saline environments in plants. Class II HKT transporters, a distinct subgroup found predominantly in monocots, are known to mediate Na(+)-K(+) co-transport in principle. Here we report features of ion transport functions of No-OsHKT2;2/1, a class II transporter identified in a salt tolerant landrace of indica rice, Nona Bokra. We profiled No-OsHKT2;2/1 expression in organs of Nona Bokra plants with or without salinity stress. Dominant accumulation of the No-OsHKT2;2/1 transcript in K(+)-starved roots of Nona Bokra plants largely disappeared in response to 50Â mM NaCl. We found that No-OsHKT2;2/1 expressed in the high-affinity K(+) uptake deficient mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis oocytes shows robust K(+) selectivity even in the presence of a large amount of NaCl as reported previously. However, No-OsHKT2;2/1-expressing yeast cells exhibited Na(+) hypersensitive growth under various concentrations of K(+) and Na(+) as the cells expressing Po-OsHKT2;2, a similar class II transporter from another salt tolerant indica rice Pokkali, when compared with the growth of cells harboring empty vector or cells expressing OsHKT2;4. The OsHKT2;4 protein expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed strong K(+) selectivity in the presence of 50Â mM NaCl in comparison with No-OsHKT2;2/1 and Po-OsHKT2;2. Together with apparent plasma membrane-localization of No-OsHKT2;2/1, these results point to possibilities that No-OsHKT2;2/1 could mediate destructive Na(+) influx over K(+) uptake in Nona Bokra plants upon salinity stress, and that a predominant physiological function of No-OsHKT2;2/1 might be the acquisition of Na(+) and K(+) in K(+)-limited environments.
NA	A role for the OsHKT 2;1 sodium transporter in potassium use efficiency in rice.	2019	J Exp Bot	Department of Biology, University of York, York, YO1 5DD, UK.	Increasing the potassium use efficiency (KUE) of crops is important for agricultural sustainability. However, a greater understanding of this complex trait is required to develop new, high KUE cultivars. To this end, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was applied to diverse rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes grown under potassium stressed and replete conditions. Using high stringency criteria, the genetic architecture of KUE was uncovered, together with the breadth of physiological responses to low-potassium stress. Specifically, 3 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, which contained over 90 candidate genes. Of these, the sodium transporter gene OsHKT2;1 emerged as a key factor that impacts on KUE based on (i) the correlation between shoot Na+ and KUE, and (ii) higher levels of HKT2;1 expression in high KUE lines.
NA	Expression levels of the Na+/K+ transporter OsHKT2;1 and vacuolar Na+/H+ exchanger OsNHX1, Na enrichment, maintaining the photosynthetic abilities and growth performances of indica rice seedlings under salt stress.	2020	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	1National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC), National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA), 113 Paholyothin Rd., Khlong Nuang, Khlong Luang, Pathum Thani 12120 Thailand.	Salt affected soil inhibits plant growth, development and productivity, especially in case of rice crop. Ion homeostasis is a candidate defense mechanism in the salt tolerant plants or halophyte species, where the salt toxic ions are stored in the vacuoles. The aim of this investigation was to determine the OsNHX1 (a vacuolar Na+/H+ exchanger) and OsHKT2;1 (Na+/K+ transporter) regulation by salt stress (200<U+00A0>mM NaCl) in two rice cultivars, i.e. Pokkali (salt tolerant) and IR29 (salt susceptible), the accumulation of Na+ in the root and leaf tissues using CoroNa Green<U+00AE> staining dye and the associated physiological changes in test plants. Na+ content was largely increased in the root tissues of rice seedlings cv. Pokkali (15<U+00A0>min after salt stress) due to the higher expression of OsHKT2;1 gene (by 2.5 folds) in the root tissues. The expression of OsNHX1 gene in the leaf tissues was evidently increased in salt stressed seedlings of Pokkali, whereas it was unchanged in salt stressed seedlings of IR29. Na+ in the root tissues of both Pokkali and IR29 was enriched, when subjected to 200<U+00A0>mM NaCl for 12<U+00A0>h and easily detected in the leaf tissues of salt stressed plants exposed for 24<U+00A0>h, especially in cv. Pokkali. Moreover, the overexpression of OsNHX1 gene regulated the translocation of Na+ from root to leaf tissues, and compartmentation of Na+ into vacuoles, thereby maintaining the photosynthetic abilities in cv. Pokkali. Overall growth performance, maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), photon yield of PSII (¦µPSII) and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) was improved in salt stressed leaves of Pokkali than those in salt stressed IR29.
NA	Clock component OsPRR73 positively regulates rice salt tolerance by modulating OsHKT2;1-mediated sodium homeostasis	2020	EMBO J	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	The roles of clock components in salt stress tolerance remain incompletely characterized in rice. Here, we show that, among OsPRR (Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator) family members, OsPRR73 specifically confers salt tolerance in rice. Notably, the grain size and yield of osprr73 null mutants were significantly decreased in the presence of salt stress, with accumulated higher level of reactive oxygen species and sodium ions. RNA sequencing and biochemical assays identified OsHKT2;1, encoding a plasma membrane-localized Na+ transporter, as a transcriptional target of OsPRR73 in mediating salt tolerance. Correspondingly, null mutants of OsHKT2;1 displayed an increased tolerance to salt stress. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays further identified HDAC10 as nuclear interactor of OsPRR73 and co-repressor of OsHKT2;1. Consistently, H3K9ac histone marks at OsHKT2;1 promoter regions were significantly reduced in osprr73 mutant. Together, our findings reveal that salt-induced OsPRR73 expression confers salt tolerance by recruiting HDAC10 to transcriptionally repress OsHKT2;1, thus reducing cellular Na+ accumulation. This exemplifies a new molecular link between clock components and salt stress tolerance in rice.
NA	CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGrx_C7 plays a crucial role in enhancing protection against salt stress in rice	2021	J Biotechnol	Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Division, CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, India; Department of Botany, University of Lucknow, India.	Soil salinity is one of the critical issue worldwide that adversely affect soil fertility. Salt stress significantly limits crop yield and grain quality; therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a strategy to improve salt stress tolerance. In present study, we reported that rice glutaredoxin (OsGrx_C7) plays a positive response in salt induced stress. Gene expression analysis, silencing, and overexpression of OsGrx_C7 gene were used to discover the role of OsGrx_C7 in response to salt stress. Gene expression analysis suggested that OsGrx_C7 expression was induced under salt stress and ubiquitously expressed in rice including root and shoot. The silencing of osgrx_c7 gene leads to increased sensitivity to salt stress, indicating its importance in salt stress tolerance. A gain-of-function approach showed that OsGrx_C7 may act as an important determinant in salt stress, compared with WT, and revealed higher biomass accumulation, improved root and plant growth under salt stress. Under salt stress condition, OsGrx_C7 overexpressing rice plants showed lower level of lipid peroxidation and Na+/K+ ratio, while proline accumulation, soluble sugar content and GSH/GSSG ratio was higher compared to WT. Furthermore, expression analysis suggested that OsGrx_C7 acted as positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1) engaged in Na+ homeostasis in overexpressing plants. Overall our study revealed that OsGrx_C7 emerged as a key mediator in response to salt stress in rice and could be used for engineering tolerance against salt stress in rice and other crops.
