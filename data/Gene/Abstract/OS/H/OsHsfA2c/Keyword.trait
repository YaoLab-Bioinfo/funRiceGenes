OsHSF6|OsHsfA2c|OsHsfA6a	seed	Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding two novel heat-shock factor OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 in Oryza sativa L	The results of RT-PCR indicated OsHSF6 gene was expressed immediately after rice plants exposure to heat stress, and the transcription of OsHSF6 gene accumulated primarily in immature seeds, roots and leaves
OsHSF6|OsHsfA2c|OsHsfA6a	transcription factor	Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding two novel heat-shock factor OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 in Oryza sativa L	Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that OsHSF6 was a class A heat shock factor (HSF) with all the conserved sequence elements characteristic of heat stress transcription factor, while OsHSF12 was a class B HSF with C-terminal domain (CTD) lacking of AHA motif
OsHSF6|OsHsfA2c|OsHsfA6a	root	Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding two novel heat-shock factor OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 in Oryza sativa L	The results of RT-PCR indicated OsHSF6 gene was expressed immediately after rice plants exposure to heat stress, and the transcription of OsHSF6 gene accumulated primarily in immature seeds, roots and leaves
OsHSF6|OsHsfA2c|OsHsfA6a	transcription factor	Mapping of domains of heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA6a responsible for its transactivation activity.	Mapping of domains of heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA6a responsible for its transactivation activity.
OsHSF6|OsHsfA2c|OsHsfA6a	stress	Mapping of domains of heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA6a responsible for its transactivation activity.	Mapping of domains of heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA6a responsible for its transactivation activity.
