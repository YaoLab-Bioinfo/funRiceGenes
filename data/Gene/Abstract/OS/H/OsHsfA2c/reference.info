As a crucial transcription factor family, heat-shock factors were mainly analyzed and characterized in tomato and Arabidopsis. In this study, we isolated two putative heatshock factors OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 that interact specifically with heat-shock element (HSE) from Oryza sativa L by yeast one-hybrid method. The full-length cDNA of OsHSF6 and OsHSF12 have 1074bp and 920bp open reading frame (ORF), respectively. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that OsHSF6 was a class A heat shock factor (HSF) with all the conserved sequence elements characteristic of heat stress transcription factor, while OsHSF12 was a class B HSF with C-terminal domain (CTD) lacking of AHA motif. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the sequences and structures of two HSFs' DNA binding domain (DBD) had a high similarity with LpHSF24. The results of RT-PCR indicated OsHSF6 gene was expressed immediately after rice plants exposure to heat stress, and the transcription of OsHSF6 gene accumulated primarily in immature seeds, roots and leaves. However, we did not find the transcription of OsHSF12 gene in different organs and growth periods. Our results implied that OsHSF6 might be function as a HSF regulating early expression of stress genes in response to heat shock, and OsHSF12 might be act as a synergistic factor to regulate the expression of down-stream genes.
12192_2011_Article_303.pdf	OsHsfA2c and OsHsfB4b are involved in the transcriptional regulation of cytoplasmic OsClpB (Hsp100) gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2012	Cell Stress Chaperones	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	ClpB-cytoplasmic (ClpB-cyt)/Hsp100 is an important chaperone protein in rice. Cellular expression of OsClpB-cyt transcript is governed by heat stress, metal stress, and developmental cues. Transgenic rice plants produced with 2 kb OsClpB-cyt promoter driving Gus reporter gene showed heat- and metal-regulated Gus expression in vegetative tissues and constitutive Gus expression in calli, flowering tissues, and embryonal half of seeds. Rice seedlings regenerated with OsClpB-cyt promoter fragment with deletion of its canonical heat shock element sequence (HSE(-273 to -280)) showed not only heat shock inducibility of Gus transcript/protein but also constitutive expression of Gus in vegetative tissues. It thus emerges that the only classical HSE present in OsClpB-cyt promoter is involved in repressing expression of OsClpB-cyt transcript under unstressed control conditions. Yeast one-hybrid assays suggested that OsHsfA2c specifically interacts with OsClpB-cyt promoter. OsHsfA2c also showed binding with OsClpB-cyt and OsHsfB4b showed binding with OsClpB-cyt; notably, interaction of OsHsfB4b was seen for all three OsClpB/Hsp100 protein isoforms (i.e., ClpB-cytoplasmic, ClpB-mitochondrial, and ClpB-chloroplastic). Furthermore, OsHsfB4b showed interaction with OsHsfA2c. This study suggests that OsHsfA2c may play a role as transcriptional activator and that OsHsfB4b is an important part of this heat shock responsive circuitry.
JZUSB10-0291.pdf	Identification and expression analysis of OsHsfs in rice	2009	J Zhejiang Univ Sci B	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs) are the central regulators of defense response to heat stress. We identified a total of 25 rice Hsf genes by genome-wide analysis of rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome, including the subspecies of O. japonica and O. indica. Proteins encoded by OsHsfs were divided into three classes according to their structures. Digital Northern analysis showed that OsHsfs were expressed constitutively. The expressions of these OsHsfs in response to heat stress and oxidative stress differed among the members of the gene family. Promoter analysis identified a number of stress-related cis-elements in the promoter regions of these OsHsfs. No significant correlation, however, was found between the heat-shock responses of genes and their cis-elements. Overall, our results provide a foundation for future research of OsHsfs function.
NA	Mapping of domains of heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA6a responsible for its transactivation activity.	2018	Plant Sci	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	Elevated temperatures affect the growth and reproduction of crop plants and thus have become concern worldwide. Hsp101/ClpB protein is a major molecular chaperone, performing dis-aggregation of protein aggregates formed during heat stress. In rice, OsHsfA6a binds to the promoter of OsHsp101/ClpB-C and regulates its expression. In this study, analysis of C-terminal domains of ClassA OsHsfs revealed the presence of aromatic, hydrophobic, acidic (AHA) and nuclear export signal (NES) motifs in all the members. Using deletion constructs, we show that the activation potential of OsHsfA6a is confined in the C-terminal activation domain comprising of AHA and NES sequences. The results obtained in yeast were complemented with transient expression of reporter in protoplast (TERP) based assay. Detailed analysis of OsHsfA6a splice variants shows the presence of one full version and a DBD truncated smaller version whose existence needs experimental evidences. Phylogeny analysis revealed that OsHsfA6a has diverged from A6a/A6b forms of Arabidopsis and tomato and has no expressologs. OsHsfA6a in-silico network was enriched in MAP kinases along with Hsp70 and Hsp90 proteins. Thus, it appears that regulation of OsClpB-C by HsfA6a is unique in rice and activation potential of OsHsfA6a resides in the single AHA motif located in the C-terminal domain.
