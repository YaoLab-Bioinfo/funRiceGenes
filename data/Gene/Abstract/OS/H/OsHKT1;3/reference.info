Na+ uptake in the roots of K+-starved seedlings of barley, rice, and wheat was found to exhibit fast rate, low Km, and high sensitivity to K+. Sunflower plants responded in a similar manner but the uptake was not K+ sensitive. Ba2+ inhibited Na+ uptake, but not K+ uptake in rice roots. This demonstrated that Na+ and K+ uptake are mediated by different transporters, and that K+ blocked but was not transported by the Na+ transporter. The genome of rice cv. Nipponbare contains seven HKT genes, which may encode Na+ transporters, plus two HKT pseudogenes. Yeast expressions of OsHKT1 and OsHKT4 proved that they are Na+ transporters of high and low affinity, respectively, which are sensitive to K+ and Ba2+. Parallel experiments of K+ and Na+ uptake in yeast expressing the wheat or rice HKT1 transporters proved that they were very different; TaHKT1 transported K+ and Na+, and OsHKT1 only Na+. Transcript expressions in shoots of the OsHKT genes were fairly constant and insensitive to changes in the K+ and Na+ concentrations of the nutrient solution. In roots, the expressions were much lower than in shoots, except for OsHKT4 and OsHKT1 in K+-starved plants. We propose that OsHKT transporters are involved in Na+ movements in rice, and that OsHKT1 specifically mediates Na+ uptake in rice roots when the plants are K+ deficient. The incidence of HKT ESTs in several plant species suggests that the rice model with many HKT genes applies to other plants.
NA	Identification of rice cornichon as a possible cargo receptor for the Golgi-localized sodium transporter OsHKT1;3.	2015	J Exp Bot	Instituto de Biotecnología, Universidad Nacional de Autónoma de México, Cuernavaca, Morelos, 62250, México Department of Plant Biology, Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.	Membrane proteins are synthesized and folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and continue their path to their site of residence along the secretory pathway. The COPII system has been identified as a key player for selecting and directing the fate of membrane and secretory cargo proteins. Selection of cargo proteins within the COPII vesicles is achieved by cargo receptors. The cornichon cargo receptor belongs to a conserved protein family found in eukaryotes that has been demonstrated to participate in the selection of integral membrane proteins as cargo for their correct targeting. Here it is demonstrated at the cellular level that rice cornichon OsCNIH1 interacts with OsHKT1;3 and, in yeast cells, enables the expression of the sodium transporter to the Golgi apparatus. Physical and functional HKT-cornichon interactions are confirmed by the mating-based split ubiquitin system, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and Xenopus oocyte and yeast expression systems. The interaction between the two proteins occurs in the ER of plant cells and their co-expression in oocytes leads to the sequestration of the transporter in the ER. In the yeast cornichon mutant erv14, OsHKT1;3 is mistargeted, preventing the toxic effects of sodium transport in the cell observed in wild-type cells or in the erv14 mutant that co-expressed OsHKT1;3 with either OsCNIH1 or Erv14p. Identification and characterization of rice cornichon as a possible cargo receptor opens up the opportunity to improve our knowledge on membrane protein targeting in plant cells.
NA	Identification and Characterization of Rice OsHKT1;3 Variants.	2021	Plants (Basel)	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, 2-20-1 Chuo, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	In rice, the high-affinity K(+) transporter, OsHKT1;3, functions as a Na(+)-selective transporter. mRNA variants of OsHKT1;3 have been reported previously, but their functions remain unknown. In this study, five OsHKT1;3 variants (V1-V5) were identified from japonica rice (Nipponbare) in addition to OsHKT1;3_FL. Absolute quantification qPCR analyses revealed that the transcript level of OsHKT1;3_FL was significantly higher than other variants in both the roots and shoots. Expression levels of OsHKT1;3_FL, and some variants, increased after 24 h of salt stress. Two electrode voltage clamp experiments in a heterologous expression system using Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that oocytes expressing OsHKT1;3_FL and all of its variants exhibited smaller Na(+) currents. The presented data, together with previous data, provide insights to understanding how OsHKT family members are involved in the mechanisms of ion homeostasis and salt tolerance in rice.
