OsHAP3B	OsHAP3C|OsNF-YB4	OsHAP3 genes regulate chloroplast biogenesis in rice	We have isolated three genes that potentially encode a HAP3/nuclear factor-YB (NF-YB)/CCAAT binding factor-A (CBF-A) subunit of a CCAAT-box binding complex in rice (Oryza sativa), and named them OsHAP3A, OsHAP3B and OsHAP3C
OsHAP3B	OsHAP3C|OsNF-YB4	OsHAP3 genes regulate chloroplast biogenesis in rice	In the transgenic rice plants with antisense or RNAi construct of OsHAP3A, reduced expression of not only OsHAP3A but also OsHAP3B and OsHAP3C was observed
