OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	Interestingly, OsNAC6, a member of the NAM-ATAF-CUC (NAC) family, was identified as a key component of the OsHDAC1 regulon, and was found to be epigenetically repressed by OsHDAC1 overexpression
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	The root phenotype of OsNAC6 knock-out seedlings was observed to be similar to that of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	Conversely, the root phenotype of the OsNAC6 overexpressors was similar to that of the OsHDAC1 knock-out seedlings
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	These observations indicate that OsHDAC1 negatively regulates the OsNAC6 gene that primarily mediates the alteration in the root growth of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the OsNAC6 promoter region using antibodies specific to acetylated histones H3 and H4 revealed that OsHDAC1 epigenetically represses the expression of OsNAC6 by deacetylating K9, K14 and K18 on H3 and K5, K12 and K16 on H4
OsHDAC1	OsNAC6|SNAC2	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsHDAC1	The Histone Deacetylase 1/ GSK3/SHAGGY-Like Kinase 2/ BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 Module Controls Lateral Root Formation in Rice.	 Importantly, OsHDAC1 could directly interact with and deacetylate OsGSK2, inhibiting its activity
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsHDAC1	The Histone Deacetylase 1/ GSK3/SHAGGY-Like Kinase 2/ BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 Module Controls Lateral Root Formation in Rice.	 Taken together, the results indicate that OsHDAC1 regulates LR formation in rice by deactivating OsGSK2, thereby preventing degradation of OsBZR1, a positive regulator of LR primordia formation
OsBZR1|BZR1	OsHDAC1	The Histone Deacetylase 1/ GSK3/SHAGGY-Like Kinase 2/ BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 Module Controls Lateral Root Formation in Rice.	 Taken together, the results indicate that OsHDAC1 regulates LR formation in rice by deactivating OsGSK2, thereby preventing degradation of OsBZR1, a positive regulator of LR primordia formation
