Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate chromatin structure and transcription. HDACs have been studied as negative regulators in eukaryotic transcription. We isolated the rice OsHDAC1-3 genes for class I-type histone deacetylases, which are related to the RPD3 family. The OsHDAC1 gene encoded a protein of approximately 57 kDa that shared 73.5, 72.7, 79.9, and 57.1% amino acid sequence identity with the OsHDAC2, OsHDAC3, maize RPD3, and human HDAC1 proteins, respectively. Genomic structures and Southern blot analyses revealed that OsHDAC1-3 contained seven, six, and seven exons, respectively, and constituted a class I-type family in the rice genome. OsHDAC1 was expressed at similar levels in the leaves, roots, and callus cells, whereas OsHDAC2 and 3 were expressed in the roots and callus cells, but not in the leaves, exhibiting distinct tissue specificity. To explore the role of histone deacetylases in transgenic plants, we inserted the OsHDAC1 cDNA fragment into the expression vector Ai::OsHDAC1 under the control of the ABA-inducible promoter Ai, and transformed the construct into rice. Levels of mRNA, protein, and HDAC activity were significantly increased in Ai::OsHDAC1 callus cells. The amount of tetra-acetylated H4 in the transgenic cells was greatly reduced, and the reduction was abolished upon treatment with trichostatin A. These results demonstrate that OsHDAC1 overexpression in transgenic cells both yields enzymatically active HDAC complexes and induces changes in histone acetylation in vivo. The overexpression leads to a range of novel phenotypes, involving increased growth rate and altered plant architecture, suggesting that OsHDAC1 functions in the genome-wide programming of gene expression.
j.1365-313X.2009.03908.x.pdf	The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice	2009	The Plant Journal	School of Biotechnology and Environmental Engineering, Myongji University, Yongin, Korea.	We have previously isolated a rice gene encoding a histone deacetylase, OsHDAC1, and observed that its transgenic overexpression increases seedling root growth. To identify the transcriptional repression events that occur as a result of OsHDAC1 overexpression (OsHDAC1(OE)), a global profiling of root-expressed genes was performed on OsHDAC1(OE) or HDAC inhibitor-treated non-transgenic (NT) roots, in comparison with untreated NT roots. We selected 39 genes that are induced and repressed in HDAC inhibitor-treated NT and OsHDAC1(OE) roots, compared with NT roots, respectively. Interestingly, OsNAC6, a member of the NAM-ATAF-CUC (NAC) family, was identified as a key component of the OsHDAC1 regulon, and was found to be epigenetically repressed by OsHDAC1 overexpression. The root phenotype of OsNAC6 knock-out seedlings was observed to be similar to that of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings. Conversely, the root phenotype of the OsNAC6 overexpressors was similar to that of the OsHDAC1 knock-out seedlings. These observations indicate that OsHDAC1 negatively regulates the OsNAC6 gene that primarily mediates the alteration in the root growth of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the OsNAC6 promoter region using antibodies specific to acetylated histones H3 and H4 revealed that OsHDAC1 epigenetically represses the expression of OsNAC6 by deacetylating K9, K14 and K18 on H3 and K5, K12 and K16 on H4.
NA	Histone deacetylase HDA710 controls salt tolerance by regulating ABA signaling in rice	2020	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan, 430030, China.	Plants have evolved numerous mechanisms that assist them in withstanding environmental stresses. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play crucial roles in plant stress responses; however, their regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the function of HDA710/OsHDAC2, a member of the HDAC RPD3/HDA1 family, in stress tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). We established that HDA710 localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm and is involved in regulating the acetylation of histone H3 and H4, specifically targeting H4K5 and H4K16 under normal conditions. HDA710 transcript accumulation levels were strongly induced by abiotic stresses including drought and salinity, as well as by the phytohormones jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA). hda710 knockout mutant plants showed enhanced salinity tolerance and reduced ABA sensitivity, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing HDA710 displayed the opposite phenotypes. Moreover, ABA- and salt-stress-responsive genes, such as OsLEA3, OsABI5, OsbZIP72, and OsNHX1, were upregulated in hda710 compared with wild-type plants. These expression differences corresponded with higher levels of histone H4 acetylation in gene promoter regions in hda710 compared with the wild type under ABA and salt-stress treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that HDA710 is involved in regulating ABA- and salt-stress-responsive genes by altering H4 acetylation levels in their promoters.
