OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsNHA1|OsSOS1	Effects of salt stress on ion balance and nitrogen metabolism of old and young leaves in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	In addition, lower expression of OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1 in old leaves may decrease frequency of retrieving Na+ from old leaf cells
OsHKT1;1|OsHKT4	OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	A conserved primary salt tolerance mechanism mediated by HKT transporters: a mechanism for sodium exclusion and maintenance of high K(+)/Na(+) ratio in leaves during salinity stress	Here we present a review on vital physiological functions of HKT transporters including AtHKT1;1 and OsHKT1;5 in preventing shoot Na(+) over-accumulation by mediating Na(+) exclusion from xylem vessels in the presence of a large amount of Na(+) thereby protecting leaves from salinity stress
OsHKT1;4	OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing	Amongst these transporters, the cereal HKT1;4 and HKT1;5 are responsible for Na(+) exclusion from photosynthetic tissues, a key mechanism for plant salinity tolerance
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsPEX11	OsPEX11, a Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 11, Contributes to Salt Stress Tolerance in Oryza sativa.	Furthermore, qPCR data suggested that OsPEX11 acted as a positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of several well-known rice transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5, OsLti6a, OsLti6b, OsSOS1, OsNHX1, and OsAKT1) involved in Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis in transgenic plants under salinity
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsJRL	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	Overexpression of OsJRL in rice also enhanced salinity tolerance and increased the expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including three LEA (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) genes (OsLEA19a, OsLEA23 and OsLEA24), three Na(+) transporter genes (OsHKT1;3, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5) and two DREB genes (OsDREB1A and OsDREB2B)
OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsMGT1	A magnesium transporter OsMGT1 plays a critical role in salt tolerance in rice.	 Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg transporter OsMGT1 is required for the salt-tolerance probably by regulating transport activity of OsHKT1;5, a key transporter for the removal of Na+ from the xylem sap at the root mature zone

OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8	OsMGT1	A magnesium transporter OsMGT1 plays a critical role in salt tolerance in rice.	 Taken together, our results suggest that Mg2+ transported by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots
