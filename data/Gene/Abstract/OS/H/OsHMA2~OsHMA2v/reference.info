Fractioning of Cd ions retained by roots revealed that different events along the metal sequestration pathway (i.e. chelation by thiols, vacuolar compartmentalization, adsorption) contributed to Cd immobilization in the roots. However, large amounts of Cd ions (around 24% of the total amount) predictable as potentially mobile were still found in all conditions, while the amount of Cd ions loaded in the xylem seemed to have already reached saturation at 0.1 microM Cd(2)+, suggesting that Cd translocation may also play an indirect role in determining Cd root retention, especially at the highest external concentrations. In silico search and preliminary analyses in yeast suggest OsHMA2 as a good candidate for the control of Cd xylem loading in rice. Taken as a whole, data indicate Cd chelation, compartmentalization, adsorption and translocation processes as components of a complex 'firewall system' which acts in limiting Cd translocation from the root to the shoot and which reaches different equilibrium positions depending on Cd external concentration.
j.1365-3040.2012.02527.x.pdf	The OsHMA2 transporter is involved in root-to-shoot translocation of Zn and Cd in rice	2012	Plant Cell Environ	Graduate School of Agricultural & Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.	Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient for plants and humans. Cadmium (Cd) is a Zn analog and one of the most toxic heavy metals to humans. Here we investigated the role of the Zn/Cd transporter OsHMA2. OsHMA2:GFP fusion protein localized to the plasma membrane in onion epidermal cells. The yeast expressing OsHMA2 was able to reverse the growth defect in the presence of excess Zn. The expression of OsHMA2 in rice was observed mainly in the roots where OsHMA2 transcripts were abundant in vascular bundles. Furthermore, Zn and Cd concentrations of OsHMA2-suppressed rice decreased in the leaves, while the Zn concentration increased in the roots compared with the wild type (WT). These results suggest that OsHMA2 plays a role in Zn and Cd loading to the xylem and participates in root-to-shoot translocation of these metals in rice. Furthermore, the Cd concentration in the grains of OsHMA2-overexpressing rice as well as in OsSUT1-promoter OsHMA2 rice decreased to about half that of the WT, although the other metal concentrations were the same as in the WT. A phenotype that reduces only the Cd concentration in rice grains will be very useful for transgenic approaches to food safety.
Plant Cell Physiol-2012-Satoh-Nagasawa-213-24.pdf	Mutations in rice (Oryza sativa) heavy metal ATPase 2 (OsHMA2) restrict the translocation of zinc and cadmium	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biological Production, Faculty of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, Shimoshinjyo-Nakano, Akita, Japan. satohnagasawa@akita-pu.ac.jp	Widespread soil contamination with heavy metals has fostered the need for plant breeders to develop new crops that do not accumulate heavy metals. Metal-transporting transmembrane proteins that transport heavy metals across the plant plasma membrane are key targets for developing these new crops. Oryza sativa heavy metal ATPase 3 (OsHMA3) is known to be a useful gene for limiting cadmium (Cd) accumulation in rice. OsHMA2 is a close homolog of OsHMA3, but the function of OsHMA2 is unknown. To gain insight into the function of OsHMA2, we analyzed three Tos17 insertion mutants. The translocation ratios of zinc (Zn) and Cd were clearly lower in all mutants than in the wild type, suggesting that OsHMA2 is a major transporter of Zn and Cd from roots to shoots. By comparing each allele in the OsHMA2 protein structure and measuring the Cd translocation ratio, we identified the C-terminal region as essential for Cd translocation into shoots. Two alleles were identified as good material for breeding rice that does not contain Cd in the grain but does contain some Zn, and that grows normally.
Plant Physiol.-2013-Yamaji-pp.113.216564.pdf	Preferential delivery of zinc to developing tissues in rice is mediated by P-type heavy metal ATPase OsHMA2	2013	Plant Physiol	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	Developing tissues such as meristems and reproductive organs require high zinc, but the molecular mechanisms of how zinc taken up by the roots is preferentially delivered to these tissues with low transpiration are unknown. Here, we report that rice (Oryza sativa) heavy metal ATPase2 (OsHMA2), a member of P-type ATPases, is involved in preferential delivery of zinc to the developing tissues in rice. OsHMA2 was mainly expressed in the mature zone of the roots at the vegetative stage, but higher expression was also found in the nodes at the reproductive stage. The expression was unaffected by either zinc deficiency or zinc excess. OsHMA2 was localized at the pericycle of the roots and at the phloem of enlarged and diffuse vascular bundles in the nodes. Heterologous expression of OsHMA2 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) showed influx transport activity for zinc as well as cadmium. Two independent Tos17 insertion lines showed decreased zinc concentration in the crown root tips, decreased concentration of zinc and cadmium in the upper nodes and reproductive organs compared with wild-type rice. Furthermore, a short-term labeling experiment with (67)Zn showed that the distribution of zinc to the panicle and uppermost node I was decreased, but that, to the lower nodes, was increased in the two mutants. Taken together, OsHMA2 in the nodes plays an important role in preferential distribution of zinc as well as cadmium through the phloem to the developing tissues.
NA	Silicon reduces cadmium accumulation by suppressing expression of transporter genes involved in cadmium uptake and translocation in rice.	2017	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China.	Silicon (Si) alleviates cadmium (Cd) toxicity and accumulation in a number of plant species, but the exact molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of Si on Cd toxicity and accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa) by using two mutants (lsi1 and lsi2) defective in Si uptake and their wild types (WTs). Root elongation was decreased with increasing external Cd concentrations in both WTs and mutants, but Si did not show an alleviative effect on Cd toxicity in all lines. By contrast, the Cd concentration in both the shoots and roots was decreased by Si in the WTs, but not in the mutants. Furthermore, Si supply resulted in a decreased Cd concentration in the root cell sap and xylem sap in the WTs, but not in the mutants. Pre-treatment with Si also decreased Cd accumulation in the WTs, but not in the mutants. Silicon slightly decreased Cd accumulation in the cell wall of the roots. The expression level of OsNramp5 and OsHMA2 was down-regulated by Si in the WTs, but not in the mutants. These results indicate that the Si-decreased Cd accumulation was caused by down-regulating transporter genes involved in Cd uptake and translocation in rice.
NA	Effective reduction of cadmium accumulation in rice grain by expressing OsHMA3 under the control of OsHMA2 promoter.	2018	J Exp Bot	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Kurashiki, Japan.	Reducing Cd accumulation in the rice grain is an important issue for human health. The aim of this study is to manipulate both expression and tissue localization of OsHMA3, a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter in the roots by expressing it under the control of OsHMA2 promoter, which shows high expression in different organs including roots, nodes and shoots. In two independent transgenic lines, the expression of OsHMA3 was significantly enhanced in all organs compared with the non-transgenic rice. Furthermore, OsHMA3 protein was detected in the root pericycle cells and phloem region of both the diffuse vascular bundle and the enlarged vascular bundle of the nodes. At the vegetative stage, the Cd concentration in the shoots and xylem sap of the transgenic rice was significantly decreased, but that of the whole roots and root cell sap was increased. At the reproductive stage, the concentration of Cd, but not other essential metals in the brown rice of transgenic lines was decreased to less than 1/10 of the non-transgenic rice. These results indicate that expression of OsHMA3 under the control of OsHMA2 promoter can effectively reduce Cd accumulation in rice grain through sequestering more Cd into the vacuoles of various tissues.
