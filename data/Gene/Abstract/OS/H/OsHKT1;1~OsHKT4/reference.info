BACKGROUND: It is well known that salt stress has different effects on old and young tissues. However, it remains largely unexplored whether old and young tissues have different regulatory mechanism during adaptation of plants to salt stress. The aim of this study was to investigate whether salt stress has different effects on the ion balance and nitrogen metabolism in the old and young leaves of rice, and to compare functions of both organs in rice salt tolerance. RESULTS: Rice protected young leaves from ion harm via the large accumulation of Na+ and Cl- in old leaves. The up-regulation of OsHKT1;1, OsHAK10 and OsHAK16 might contribute to accumulation of Na+ in old leaves under salt stress. In addition, lower expression of OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1 in old leaves may decrease frequency of retrieving Na+ from old leaf cells. Under salt stress, old leaves showed higher concentration of NO3- content than young leaves. Up-regulation of OsNRT1;2, a gene coding nitrate transporter, might contribute to the accumulation of NO3- in the old leaves of salt stressed-rice. Salt stress clearly up-regulated the expression of OsGDH2 and OsGDH3 in old leaves, while strongly down-regulated expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves. CONCLUSIONS: The down-regulation of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves might be a harmful response to excesses of Na+ and Cl-. Under salt stress, rice might accumulate Na+ and Cl- to toxic levels in old leaves. This might influence photorespiration process, reduce NH4+ production from photorespiration, and immediately down-regulate the expression of OsGS2 and OsFd-GOGAT in old leaves of salt stressed rice. Excesses of Na+ and Cl- also might change the pathway of NH4+ assimilation in old leaves of salt stressed rice plants, weaken GOGAT/GS pathway and elevate GDH pathway.
J. Exp. Bot.-2006-Kader-4257-68.pdf	Expressions of OsHKT1, OsHKT2, and OsVHA are differentially regulated under NaCl stress in salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars	2006	J Exp Bot	Department of Plant Biology and Forest Genetics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Box 7080, SE 75007 Uppsala, Sweden. abdul.kader@vbsg.slu.se	Under NaCl-dominated salt stress, the key to plant survival is maintaining a low cytosolic Na(+) level or Na(+)/K(+) ratio. The OsHKT1, OsHKT2, and OsVHA transporter genes might play important roles in maintaining cytosolic Na(+) homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa L. indica cvs Pokkali and BRRI Dhan29). Upon NaCl stress, the OsHKT1 transcript was significantly down-regulated in salt-tolerant cv. Pokkali, but not in salt-sensitive cv. BRRI Dhan29. NaCl stress induced the expression of OsHKT2 and OsVHA in both Pokkali and BRRI Dhan29. In cv. Pokkali, OsHKT2 and OsVHA transcripts were induced immediately after NaCl stress. However, in cv. BRRI Dhan29, the induction of OsHKT2 was quite low and of OsVHA was low and delayed, compared with that in cv. Pokkali. OsHKT2 and OsVHA induction mostly occurred in the phloem, in the transition from phloem to mesophyll cells, and in the mesophyll cells of the leaves. The vacuolar area in cv. Pokkali did not change under either short- (5-10 min) or long-term (24 h) salt stress, although it significantly increased 24 h after the stress in cv. BRRI Dhan29. When expressional constructs of VHA-c and VHA-a with YFP and CFP were introduced into isolated protoplasts of cvs Pokkali and BRRI Dhan29, the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency between VHA-c and VHA-a upon salt stress decreased slightly in cv. Pokkali, but increased significantly in cv. BRRI Dhan29. The results suggest that the salt-tolerant cv. Pokkali regulates the expression of OsHKT1, OsHKT2, and OsVHA differently from how the salt-sensitive cv. BRRI Dhan29 does. Together, these proteins might confer salt tolerance in Pokkali by maintaining a low cytosolic Na(+) level and a correct ratio of cytosolic Na(+)/K(+).

Increasing soil salinity is a serious threat to agricultural productions worldwide in the 21st century. Several essential Na(+) transporters such as AtNHX1 and AtSOS1 function in Na(+) tolerance under salinity stress in plants. Recently, evidence for a new primary salt tolerance mechanism has been reported, which is mediated by a class of HKT transporters both in dicots such as Arabidopsis and monocot crops such as rice and wheat. Here we present a review on vital physiological functions of HKT transporters including AtHKT1;1 and OsHKT1;5 in preventing shoot Na(+) over-accumulation by mediating Na(+) exclusion from xylem vessels in the presence of a large amount of Na(+) thereby protecting leaves from salinity stress. Findings of the HKT2 transporter sub-family are also updated in this review. Subjects regarding function and regulation of HKT transporters, which need to be elucidated in future research, are discussed.

Na+ uptake in the roots of K+-starved seedlings of barley, rice, and wheat was found to exhibit fast rate, low Km, and high sensitivity to K+. Sunflower plants responded in a similar manner but the uptake was not K+ sensitive. Ba2+ inhibited Na+ uptake, but not K+ uptake in rice roots. This demonstrated that Na+ and K+ uptake are mediated by different transporters, and that K+ blocked but was not transported by the Na+ transporter. The genome of rice cv. Nipponbare contains seven HKT genes, which may encode Na+ transporters, plus two HKT pseudogenes. Yeast expressions of OsHKT1 and OsHKT4 proved that they are Na+ transporters of high and low affinity, respectively, which are sensitive to K+ and Ba2+. Parallel experiments of K+ and Na+ uptake in yeast expressing the wheat or rice HKT1 transporters proved that they were very different; TaHKT1 transported K+ and Na+, and OsHKT1 only Na+. Transcript expressions in shoots of the OsHKT genes were fairly constant and insensitive to changes in the K+ and Na+ concentrations of the nutrient solution. In roots, the expressions were much lower than in shoots, except for OsHKT4 and OsHKT1 in K+-starved plants. We propose that OsHKT transporters are involved in Na+ movements in rice, and that OsHKT1 specifically mediates Na+ uptake in rice roots when the plants are K+ deficient. The incidence of HKT ESTs in several plant species suggests that the rice model with many HKT genes applies to other plants.
NA	The OsHKT1;1 Transporter is Involved in Salt Tolerance and Regulated by an MYB-Type Transcription Factor.	2015	Plant Physiol	CITY: Nanjing POSTAL_CODE: 210095 China [CN] Nanjing Agricultural University whzhang@njau.edu.cn.	Sodium transporters play key roles in plant tolerance to salt stress. Here, we report that a member of the High-Affinity K+ Transporter (HKT) family, OsHKT1;1, in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) plays an important role in reducing Na+ accumulation in shoots to cope with salt stress. The oshkt1;1 mutant plants displayed hypersensitivity to salt stress. They contained less Na+ in the phloem sap and accumulated more Na+ in the shoots compared to the wild type. OsHKT1;1 was expressed mainly in the phloem of leaf blades and up-regulated in response to salt stress. Using a yeast one-hybrid approach, a novel MYB coiled-coil type transcription factor, OsMYBc, was found to bind to the OsHKT1;1 promoter. In planta chromatin immunoprecipitation and in vitro electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrated that OsMYBc binds to AAANATNC(C/T) fragments within the OsHKT1;1 promoter. Mutation of the OsMYBc-binding nucleotides resulted in a decrease in promoter activity of OsHKT1;1. Knockout of OsMYBc resulted in a reduction in NaCl-induced expression of OsHKT1;1 and salt sensitivity. Taken together, these results suggest that OsHKT1;1 has a role in controlling Na+ concentration and preventing sodium toxicity in leaf blades, and is regulated by the OsMYBc transcription factor.
NA	Expression and Ion Transport Activity of Rice OsHKT1;1 Variants.	2019	Plants (Basel)	Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, 2-20-1, Chuo, Kurashiki 710-0046, Japan.	OsHKT1;1 in rice, belongs to the high-affinity K+ Transporter family, has been found to be involved in salt tolerance. OsHKT1;1 in japonica rice (Nipponbare) produces mRNA variants, but their functions remain elusive. In salt tolerant rice, Pokkali, eight OsHKT1;1 variants (V1-V8) were identified in addition to the full-length OsHKT1;1 (FL) cDNA. Absolute quantification by qPCR revealed that accumulation of OsHKT1;1-FL mRNA is minor in contrast to that of OsHKT1;1-V1, -V2, -V4, and -V7 mRNAs, all of which are predominant in shoots, while only V1 and V7 mRNAs are predominant in roots. Two electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) experiments using Xenopuslaevis oocytes revealed that oocytes-expressing OsHKT1;1-FL from Pokkali exhibited inward-rectified currents in the presence of 96 mM Na+ as reported previously. Further TEVC analyses indicated that six of eight OsHKT1;1 variants elicited currents in a Na+ or a K+ bath solution. OsHKT1;1-V6 exhibited a similar inward rectification to the FL protein. Contrastingly, however, the rests mediated bidirectional currents in both Na+ and K+ bath solutions. These data suggest possibilities that novel mechanisms regulating the transport activity of OsHKT1;1 might exist, and that OsHKT1;1 variants might also carry out distinct physiological roles either independently or in combination with OsHKT1;1-FL.
