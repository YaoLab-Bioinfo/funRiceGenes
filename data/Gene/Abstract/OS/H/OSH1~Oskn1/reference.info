A rice homeobox gene, OSH1, contains two functionally independent promoters which generate a larger transcript and a smaller transcript. In Arabidopsis, each promoter can drive the expression of a reporter gene in a different manner, indicating that the expression of different sized transcripts is independently regulated by each promoter. Over-expression of the larger transcript in transformed plants caused altered morphologies (Matsuoka et al., Plant Cell, 1993, 5, 1039-1048); in contrast, over-expression of the smaller transcript did not cause any morphological changes. The results suggest that the product of the smaller transcript fails to alter the expression of its target gene(s) in the transformants, while that of the larger transcript is capable of altering the expression of its target gene(s).

Five rice homeobox (OSH) genes were overexpressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the rice actin gene promoter in transgenic rice plants. Almost all of the transgenic plants showed abnormal phenotypes, which could be classified into three types according to their severity. Plants with the most severe phenotype formed only green organs, with many shoot apices on their adaxial sides. Plants with an intermediate phenotype formed bladeless leaves with normally developed leaf sheaths. Plants with a mild phenotype formed normal leaf sheaths and blades, but lacked ligules and showed diffusion of the blade-sheath boundary. The leaf structure of this phenotype was similar to that of dominant maize mutants, such as Kn1, Rs1, Lg3, and Lg4. Based on these phenotypes, we suggest that ectopic expression of the rice OSH genes interferes with the development of leaf blades and maintains leaves in less differentiated states. These results are discussed in relation to the leaf maturation schedule hypothesis (M. Freeling et al., 1992, BioEssays 14, 227-236).
1-s2.0-S0168945208000022-main.pdf	Disruption of KNOX gene suppression in leaf by introducing its cDNA in rice	2008	Plant Science	Plant Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, 1111 Yata, Mishima, Shizuoka-ken 411-8540, Japan	KNOX class 1 homeobox genes play a crucial role in formation and/or maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in plants, and their SAM-specific expression is essential for normal development of plants. We examined regulation of expression of OSH1, a KNOX gene in rice. A 5' upstream region of OSH1 had the ability to direct the expression of a reporter gene in leaf in addition to the SAM. Introduction of OSH1 cDNA without a promoter sequence caused ectopic expression of both endogenous OSH1 and introduced OSH1 cDNA itself into the leaf, which resulted in morphological abnormalities in the leaf resembling those of the overexpressors. These results indicate that an extra copy of OSH1 exons with no promoter sequence disrupts suppression of OSH1 in the transgenic leaf. Introduction of cDNAs of two other KNOX genes, OSH15 and OSH71, also showed ectopic expression. These results suggest that the exon sequences of KNOX genes function as one of the major cis-regulatory elements of KNOX gene expression. We present and discuss a possible model which interprets these results.

In many eukaryotic organisms including plants, homeobox genes are thought to be master regulators that establish the cellular or regional identities and specify the fundamental body plan. We isolated and characterized a cDNA designated OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox 15) that encodes a KNOTTED-type homeodomain protein. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the OSH15 cDNA showed a dramatically altered morphological phenotype caused by disturbance of specific aspects of tobacco development, thereby indicating the involvement of OSH15 in plant development. We analyzed the in situ mRNA localization of OSH15 through the whole plant life cycle, comparing the expression pattern with that of another rice homeobox gene, OSH1. In early embryogenesis, both genes were expressed as the same pattern at a region where the shoot apical meristem would develop later. In late embryogenesis, the expression pattern of the two genes became different. Whereas the expression of OSH1 continued within the shoot apical meristem, OSH15 expression within the shoot apical meristem ceased but became observable in a ring shaped pattern at the boundaries of some embryonic organs. This pattern of expression was similar to that observed around vegetative or reproductive shoots, or the floral meristem in mature plants. RNA in situ localization data suggest that OSH15 may play roles in the shoot organization during early embryogenesis and thereafter, OSH15 may be involved in morphogenetic events around the shoot apical meristem.
10.1023-A-1006153506868.pdf	Characterization of the KNOX class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 identified in a collection of cDNA libraries covering the early stages of rice embryogenesis	1999	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Molecular Plant Sciences, Leiden University, The Netherlands.	For identification of genes involved in embryogenesis in the model cereal rice, we have constructed a collection of cDNA libraries of well-defined stages of embryo development before, during and after organ differentiation. Here, we focus on the possible role of KNOX (maize Knotted1-like) class homeobox genes in regulation of rice embryogenesis. Three types of KNOX clones were identified in libraries of early zygotic embryos. Two of these, Oskn2 and Oskn3, encode newly described KNOX genes, whereas the third (Oskn1) corresponds to the previously described OSH1 gene. In situ hybridizations showed that during the early stages of embryo development, all three KNOX genes are expressed in the region where the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is organizing, suggesting that these genes are involved in regulating SAM formation. Whereas OSH1 was previously proposed to function also in SAM maintenance, Oskn3 may be involved in patterning organ positions, as its expression was found to mark the boundaries of different embryonic organs following SAM formation. The expression pattern of Oskn2 suggested an additional role in scutellum and epiblast development. Transgenic expression of Oskn2 and Oskn3 in tobacco further supported their involvement in cell fate determination, like previously reported for Knotted1 and OSH1 ectopic expression. Whereas Oskn3 transformants showed the most pronounced phenotypic effects during vegetative development, Oskn2 transformants showed relatively mild alterations in the vegetative phase but a more severely affected flower morphology. The observation that the KNOX genes produce similar though distinct phenotypic reponses in tobacco, indicates that their gene products act on overlapping but different sets of target genes, or that cell-type specific factors determine their precise action.
1069_ftp.pdf	KNOX homeobox genes are sufficient in maintaining cultured cells in an undifferentiated state in rice	2001	Genesis	Plant Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka-ken, Japan.	We produced transgenic rice calli, which constitutively express each of four KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes of rice, OSH1, OSH16, OSH15, and OSH71, and found that constitutive and ectopic expression of such genes inhibits normal regeneration from transformed calli, which showed continuous growth around their shoot-regenerating stages. Transgenic calli transferred onto regeneration medium began to display green spots, a sign of regeneration, but most of the transformants continued to propagate green spots at given stages. In the normal shoot-regeneration process of calli, expression of endogenous OSH1 was restricted in presumptive shoot-regenerating regions of calli and not observed in other areas. This restricted expression pattern should be required for further differentiation of the regenerating shoots. Thus our present results support the proposed function that KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes play a role in the formation and maintenance of the undetermined meristematic state of cells.
111651.pdf	Regional expression of the rice KN1-type homeobox gene family during embryo, shoot, and flower development	1999	Plant Cell	Nagoya University, BioScience Center, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	We report the isolation, sequence, and pattern of gene expression of members of the KNOTTED1 (KN1)-type class 1 homeobox gene family from rice. Phylogenetic analysis and mapping of the rice genome revealed that all of the rice homeobox genes that we have isolated have one or two direct homologs in maize. Of the homeobox genes that we tested, all exhibited expression in a restricted region of the embryo that defines the position at which the shoot apical meristem (SAM) would eventually develop, prior to visible organ formation. Several distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns were observed for the different genes in this region. After shoot formation, the expression patterns of these homeobox genes were variable in the region of the SAM. These results suggest that the rice KN1-type class 1 homeobox genes function cooperatively to establish the SAM before shoot formation and that after shoot formation, their functions differ.
1179.pdf	Decreased GA1 Content Caused by the Overexpression of OSH1 Is Accompanied by Suppression of GA 20-Oxidase Gene Expression	1998	Plant Physiol	Division of Pomology, National Institute of Fruit Tree Science, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8605, Japan	We previously reported that overexpression of the rice homeobox gene OSH1 led to altered morphology and hormone levels in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants. Among the hormones whose levels were changed, GA1 was dramatically reduced. Here we report the results of our analysis on the regulatory mechanism(s) ofOSH1 on GA metabolism. GA53 and GA20, precursors of GA1, were applied separately to transgenic tobacco plants exhibiting severely changed morphology due to overexpression of OSH1. Only treatment with the end product of GA 20-oxidase, GA20, resulted in a striking promotion of stem elongation in transgenic tobacco plants. The internal GA1 and GA20 contents inOSH1-transformed tobacco were dramatically reduced compared with those of wild-type plants, whereas the level of GA19, a mid-product of GA 20-oxidase, was 25% of the wild-type level. We have isolated a cDNA encoding a putative tobacco GA 20-oxidase, which is mainly expressed in vegetative stem tissue. RNA-blot analysis revealed that GA 20-oxidase gene expression was suppressed in stem tissue of OSH1-transformed tobacco plants. Based on these results, we conclude that overexpression ofOSH1 causes a reduction of the level of GA1by suppressing GA 20-oxidase expression.
4368.pdf	Positive autoregulation of a KNOX gene is essential for shoot apical meristem maintenance in rice	2011	Plant Cell	Genetic Strains Research Center, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan.	Self-maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), from which aerial organs are formed throughout the life cycle, is crucial in plant development. Class I Knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) genes restrict cell differentiation and play an indispensable role in maintaining the SAM. However, the mechanism that positively regulates their expression is unknown. Here, we show that expression of a rice (Oryza sativa) KNOX gene, Oryza sativa homeobox1 (OSH1), is positively regulated by direct autoregulation. Interestingly, loss-of-function mutants of OSH1 lose the SAM just after germination but can be rescued to grow until reproductive development when they are regenerated from callus. Double mutants of osh1 and d6, a loss-of-function mutant of OSH15, fail to establish the SAM both in embryogenesis and regeneration. Expression analyses in these mutants reveal that KNOX gene expression is positively regulated by the phytohormone cytokinin and by KNOX genes themselves. We demonstrate that OSH1 directly binds to five KNOX loci, including OSH1 and OSH15, through evolutionarily conserved cis-elements and that the positive autoregulation of OSH1 is indispensable for its own expression and SAM maintenance. Thus, the maintenance of the indeterminate state mediated by positive autoregulation of a KNOX gene is an indispensable mechanism of self-maintenance of the SAM.
Development-2004-Suzaki-5649-57.pdf	The gene FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 regulates floral meristem size in rice and encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase orthologous to Arabidopsis CLAVATA1	2004	Development	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	The regulation of floral organ number is closely associated with floral meristem size. Mutations in the gene FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1) cause enlargement of the floral meristem in Oryza sativa (rice), resulting in an increase in the number of all floral organs. Ectopic floral organs develop in the whorl of each organ and/or in the additional whorls that form. Inner floral organs are more severely affected than outer floral organs. Many carpel primordia develop indeterminately, and undifferentiated meristematic tissues remain in the center in almost-mature flowers. Consistent with this result, OSH1, a molecular marker of meristematic indeterminate cells in rice, continues to be expressed in this region. Although floral meristems are strongly affected by the fon1-2 mutation, vegetative and inflorescence meristems are largely normal, even in this strong allele. We isolated the FON1 gene by positional cloning and found that it encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase most similar to CLAVATA1 (CLV1) in Arabidopsis thaliana. This suggests that a pathway similar to the CLV signaling system that regulates meristem maintenance in Arabidopsis is conserved in the grass family. Unlike CLV1, which is predominantly expressed in the L3 layer of the shoot meristem, FON1 is expressed throughout the whole floral meristem, suggesting that small modifications to the CLV signaling pathway may be required to maintain the floral meristem in rice. In addition, FON1 transcripts are detected in all meristems responsible for development of the aerial part of rice, suggesting that genes sharing functional redundancy with FON1 act in the vegetative and inflorescence meristems to mask the effects of the fon1 mutation.
j.1365-313X.2009.03952.x.pdf	A rice tryptophan deficient dwarf mutant, tdd1, contains a reduced level of indole acetic acid and develops abnormal flowers and organless embryos	2009	Plant J	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. sazuka@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp	Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) plays a critical role in many aspects of plant growth and development; however, complete pathways of biosynthesis, localization and many aspects of functions of IAA in rice remain unclear. Here, we report the analysis of a rice tryptophan- (Trp-) and IAA-deficient mutant, tryptophan deficient dwarf1 (tdd1), which is embryonic lethal because of a failure to develop most organs during embryogenesis. Regenerated tdd1 plants showed pleiotropic phenotypes: dwarfing, narrow leaves, short roots and abnormal flowers. TDD1 encodes a protein homologous to anthranilate synthase beta-subunit, which catalyses the first step of the Trp biosynthesis pathway and functions upstream of Trp-dependent IAA biosynthesis. TDD1-uidA and DR5-uidA expression overlapped at many sites in WT plants but was lacking in tdd1, indicating that TDD1 is involved in auxin biosynthesis. Both Trp and IAA levels in flowers and embryos were much lower in tdd1 than in wild type (WT). Trp feeding completely rescued the mutant phenotypes and moderate expression of OsYUCCA1, which encodes a key enzyme in Trp-dependent IAA biosynthesis, also rescued plant height and root length, indicating that the abnormal phenotypes of tdd1 are caused predominantly by Trp and IAA deficiency. In tdd1 embryos, the expression patterns of OSH1 and OsSCR, which mark the presumptive apical region and the L2 layer, respectively, are identical to those in WT, suggesting a possibility either that different IAA levels are required for basic pattern formation than for organ formation or that an orthologous gene compensates for TDD1 deficiency during pattern formation.
PC12112161.pdf	Shoot organization genes regulate shoot apical meristem organization and the pattern of leaf primordium initiation in rice	2000	Plant Cell	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	The mechanism regulating the pattern of leaf initiation was analyzed by using shoot organization (sho) mutants derived from three loci (SHO1, SHO2, and SHO3). In the early vegetative phase, sho mutants show an increased rate of leaf production with random phyllotaxy. The resulting leaves are malformed, threadlike, or short and narrow. Their shoot apical meristems are relatively low and wide, that is, flat shaped, although their shape and size are highly variable among plants of the same genotype. Statistical analysis reveals that the shape of the shoot meristem rather than its size is closely correlated with the variations of plastochron and phyllotaxy. Rapid and random leaf production in sho mutants is correlated with the frequent and disorganized cell divisions in the shoot meristem and with a reduction of expression domain of a rice homeobox gene, OSH1. These changes in the organization and behavior of the shoot apical meristems suggest that sho mutants have fewer indeterminate cells and more determinate cells than wild type, with many cells acting as leaf founder cells. Thus, the SHO genes have an important role in maintaining the proper organization of the shoot apical meristem, which is essential for the normal initiation pattern of leaf primordia.
Plant Cell-1993-Matsuoka-1039-48.pdf	Expression of a rice homeobox gene causes altered morphology of transgenic plants	1993	Plant Cell	National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a homeobox sequence from rice. DNA sequence analysis of this clone, which was designated as Oryza sativa homeobox 1 (OSH1), and a genomic clone encoding the OSH1 sequence have shown that the OSH1 gene consists of five exons and encodes a polypeptide of 361 amino acid residues. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis has shown that OSH1 is a single-copy gene located near the phytochrome gene on chromosome 3. Introduction of the cloned OSH1 gene into rice resulted in altered leaf morphology, which was similar to that of the maize morphological mutant Knotted-1 (Kn1), indicating that OSH1 is a rice gene homologous to the maize Kn1 gene. RNA gel blot analysis has shown that the gene is primarily expressed in the shoot apices of young rice seedlings. This finding is supported by results of transformation experiments in which the 5' flanking region of the gene directed expression of a reporter gene in the shoot apex, particularly in stipules, of transgenic Arabidopsis. To elucidate the biological function of the OSH1 gene product, the coding region was introduced into Arabidopsis under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Almost all transformants showed abnormal morphology. The typical phenotype was the formation of clumps of abundant vegetative and reproductive shoot apices containing meristems and leaf primordia, which did not form elongated shoots. Some transformants with a less severe phenotype formed elongated shoots but had abnormally shaped leaves and flowers with stunted sepals, petals, and stamens. The abnormal phenotypes were inherited, and the level of expression of the introduced OSH1 correlates with the severity of the phenotype. These findings indicate that the abnormal morphologies of the transgenic plants are caused by the expression of the OSH1 gene product and, therefore, that OSH1 is related to the plant development process.
PNAS-1996-Sato-8117-22.pdf	A rice homeobox gene, OSH1, is expressed before organ differentiation in a specific region during early embryogenesis	1996	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Nagoya Universiity, Bioscience Center, Chikusa, Japan.	Homeobox genes encode a large family of homeodomain proteins that play a key role in the pattern formation of animal embryos. By analogy, homeobox genes in plants are thought to mediate important processes in their embryogenesis, but there is very little evidence to support this notion. Here we described the temporal and spatial expression patterns of a rice homeobox gene, OSH1, during rice embryogenesis. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that in the wild-type embryo, OSH1 was first expressed at the globular stage, much earlier than organogenesis started, in a ventral region where shoot apical meristem and epiblast would later develop. This localized expression of OSH1 indicates that the cellular differentiation has already occurred at this stage. At later stages after organogenesis had initiated, OSH1 expression was observed in shoot apical meristem [except in the L1 (tunica) layer], epiblast, radicle, and their intervening tissues in descending strength of expression level with embryonic maturation. We also performed in situ hybridization analysis with a rice organless embryo mutant, orl1, that develops no embryonic organs. In the orl1 embryo, the expression pattern of OSH1 was the same as that in the wild-type embryo in spite of the lack of embryonic organs. This shows that OSH1 is not directly associated with organ differentiation, but may be related to a regulatory process before or independent of the organ determination. The results described here strongly suggest that, like animal homeobox genes, OSH1 plays an important role in regionalization of cell identity during early embryogenesis.
NA	Genome-Wide Study of KNOX Regulatory Network Reveals Brassinosteroid Catabolic Genes Important for Shoot Meristem Function in Rice	2014	The Plant Cell	Plant Gene Expression Center, U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service, Plant and Microbial Biology Department, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720	In flowering plants, knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factors play crucial roles in establishment and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), from which aerial organs such as leaves, stems, and flowers initiate. We report that a rice (Oryza sativa) KNOX gene Oryza sativa homeobox1 (OSH1) represses the brassinosteroid (BR) phytohormone pathway through activation of BR catabolism genes. Inducible overexpression of OSH1 caused BR insensitivity, whereas loss of function showed a BR-overproduction phenotype. Genome-wide identification of loci bound and regulated by OSH1 revealed hormonal and transcriptional regulation as the major function of OSH1. Among these targets, BR catabolism genes CYP734A2, CYP734A4, and CYP734A6 were rapidly upregulated by OSH1 induction. Furthermore, RNA interference knockdown plants of CYP734A genes arrested growth of the SAM and mimicked some osh1 phenotypes. Thus, we suggest that local control of BR levels by KNOX genes is a key regulatory step in SAM function.
NA	OsMADS32 Regulates Rice Floral Patterning through Interactions with Multiple Floral Homeotic Genes	2020	J Exp Bot	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic & Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	Floral patterning is regulated by intricate networks of floral identity genes. The peculiar MADS32 subfamily genes, absent in eudicots but prevalent in monocots, regulate floral organ identity. However, how the MADS32 family genes interact with other floral homeotic genes during flower development is mostly unknown. We show here that the rice homeotic transcription factor OsMADS32 regulates floral patterning by interacting synergistically with E class protein OsMADS6 in a dosage-dependent manner. Furthermore, our results indicate important roles of OsMADS32 in defining stamen, pistil and ovule development through physical and genetic interactions with OsMADS1, OsMADS58 and OsMADS13, and in specifying floral meristem identity with OsMADS6, OsMADS3 and OsMADS58 respectively. Our findings suggest that OsMADS32 is an important factor for floral meristem identity maintenance and that it integrates the action of other MADS-box homeotic proteins to sustain floral organ specification and development in rice. Given that OsMADS32 is an orphan gene and absent in eudicots, our data substantially expand our understanding of flower development in plants.
