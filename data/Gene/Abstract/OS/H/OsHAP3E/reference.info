The OsHAP3E-overexpressing plants showed various abnormal morphologies both in their vegetative and reproductive phases. The OsHAP3E-overexpressing plants were dwarf with erected leaves and similar to brassinosteroid mutants in the vegetative phase. In the reproductive phase, dense panicle was developed, and occasionally successive generation of lateral rachises and formation of double flowers were observed. These phenotypes indicate association of OsHAP3E with determination of floral meristem identity. On the other hand, repression of OsHAP3E by RNAi or by overexpressing chimeric repressor fusion constructs brought about lethality to transformed cells, and almost no transformant was obtained. This suggests that the OsHAP3E function is essential for rice cells. Altogether, our loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses suggest that OsHAP3E plays important pleiotropic roles in vegetative and reproductive development or basic cellular processes in rice.
10.1007-s00438-007-0312-3.pdf	Identification, characterization and interaction of HAP family genes in rice	2008	Mol Genet Genomics	Genetic Strains Research Center, National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka-ken, Japan.	A HAP complex, which consists of three subunits, namely HAP2 (also called NF-YA or CBF-B), HAP3 (NF-YB/CBF-A) and HAP5 (NF-YC/CBF-C), binds to CCAAT sequences in a promoter to control the expression of target genes. We identified 10 HAP2 genes, 11 HAP3 genes and 7 HAP5 genes in the rice genome. All the three HAP family genes encode a protein with a conserved domain in each family and various non-conserved regions in both length and amino acid sequence. These genes showed various expression patterns depending on genes, and various combinations of overlapped expression of the HAP2, HAP3 and HAP5 genes were observed. Furthermore, protein interaction analyses showed interaction of OsHAP3A, a ubiquitously expressed HAP3 subunit of rice, with specific members of HAP5. These results indicate that the formation of specific complex with various HAP subunits combinations can be achieved by both tissue specific expression of three subunit genes and specific interaction of three subunit proteins. This may suggest that the HAP complexes may control various aspects of rice growth and development through tissue specific expression and complex formation of three subunit members.
jipb.12025.pdf	OsLEC1/OsHAP3E participates in the determination of meristem identity in both vegetative and reproductive developments of rice	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.	In the vegetative phase of plant development, the shoot apical meristem (SAM) produces leaf primordia in regular phyllotaxy, and transforms to the inflorescence meristem when the plant enters reproductive growth, which will undergo a series of identity differentiations and will finally form a complete and fertile panicle. Our previous studies indicated a tissue-specific expression pattern of the OsLEC1 (leafy cotyledon) gene, which is homologous to the Arabidopsis AtLEC1 gene and belongs to the CCAAT-binding protein HAP3 subfamily, during embryo development. Expression of additional OsLEC1 genomic sequences resulted in abnormalities in the development of leaves, panicles and spikelets. The spikelets in particular presented abnormities, including panicle and spikelet-like structures that occurred reiteratively inside prior spikelets, and the occasional spikelet structures that completely transformed into plantlets (a reproductive habit alteration from sexual to asexual called "pseudovivipary"). Analysis showed that OsLEC1 interacts with several SEPALLATA-like MADS transcription factors, suggesting that increased levels of the OsLEC1 protein might interfere with the normal interaction network of these MADS proteins and lead to defective spikelet development. The expression of OsMADS1 was dramatically reduced, and the DNA methylation level of cytosine in certain regions of the OsMADS1 promoter was increased under OsLEC1 overexpression. These results indicate that OsLEC1 affects the development of leaves, panicles and spikelets, and is a key regulator of meristem identity determination in both rice (Oryza sativa) vegetative and reproductive development.
NA	Rice LEAFY COTYLEDON1 Hinders Embryo Greening During the Seed Development.	2022	Front Plant Sci	College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) is the central regulator of seed development in Arabidopsis, while its function in monocots is largely elusive. We generated Oslec1 mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Oslec1 mutant seeds lost desiccation tolerance and triggered embryo greening at the early development stage. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that Oslec1 mutation altered diverse hormonal pathways and stress response in seed maturation, and promoted a series of photosynthesis-related genes. Further, genome-wide identification of OsLEC1-binding sites demonstrated that OsLEC1 bound to genes involved in photosynthesis, photomorphogenesis, as well as abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) pathways, involved in seed maturation. We illustrated an OsLEC1-regulating gene network during seed development, including the interconnection between photosynthesis and ABA/GA biosynthesis/signaling. Our findings suggested that OsLEC1 acts as not only a central regulator of seed maturation but also an inhibitor of embryo greening during rice seed development. This study would provide new understanding for the OsLEC1 regulatory mechanisms on photosynthesis in the monocot seed development.
