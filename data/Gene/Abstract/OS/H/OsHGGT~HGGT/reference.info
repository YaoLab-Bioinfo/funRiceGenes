Cahoon-2003-Metabolic redesign o.pdf	Metabolic redesign of vitamin E biosynthesis in plants for tocotrienol production and increased antioxidant content	2003	Nat Biotechnol	Crop Genetics Research and Development, Pioneer Hi-Bred, A DuPont Company, Experimental Station, Wilmington, Delaware 19880, USA. ecahoon@danforthcenter.org	Tocotrienols are the primary form of vitamin E in seeds of most monocot plants, including cereals such as rice and wheat. As potent antioxidants, tocotrienols contribute to the nutritive value of cereal grains in human and livestock diets. cDNAs encoding homogentisic acid geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT), which catalyzes the committed step of tocotrienol biosynthesis, were isolated from barley, wheat and rice seeds. Transgenic expression of the barley HGGT in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves resulted in accumulation of tocotrienols, which were absent from leaves of nontransformed plants, and a 10- to 15-fold increase in total vitamin E antioxidants (tocotrienols plus tocopherols). Overexpression of the barley HGGT in corn seeds resulted in an increase in tocotrienol and tocopherol content of as much as six-fold. These results provide insight into the genetic basis for tocotrienol biosynthesis in plants and demonstrate the ability to enhance the antioxidant content of crops by introduction of an enzyme that redirects metabolic flux.
NA	SGD1, a key enzyme in tocopherol biosynthesis, is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice.	2017	Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, PR China.	Tocopherols, a group of Vitamin E compounds, are essential components of the human diet. In contrast to well documented roles in animals, the functions of tocopherols in plants are less understood. In this study, we characterized two allelic rice dwarf mutant lines designated sgd1-1 and sgd1-2 (small grain and dwarf1). Histological observations showed that the dwarf phenotypes were mainly due to cell elongation defects. A map-based cloning strategy and subsequent complementation test showed that SGD1 encodes homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT), a key enzyme in tocopherol biosynthesis. Mutation of SGD1 resulted in tocopherol deficiency in both sgd1mutants. No oxidant damage was detected in the sgd1 mutants. Further analysis showed that sgd1-2 was hypersensitive to cold stress. Our results indicate that SGD1 is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice.
NA	Rice tocopherol deficiency 1 encodes a homogentisate phytyltransferase essential for tocopherol biosynthesis and plant development in rice.	2018	Plant Cell Rep	Provincial Key Laboratory of Agrobiology, Institute of Crop Germplasm and Biotechnology, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences/The Jiangsu Provincial Platform for Conservation and Utilization of Agricultural Germplasm, Nanjing, 210014, China.	RTD1 encodes a homogentisate phytyltransferase catalyzing a key step in rice tocopherol biosynthesis, confers cold tolerance and regulates rice development by affecting the accumulation of DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1. Tocopherols are one of the most important lipid-soluble antioxidants having indispensable roles in living organisms. The physiological functions of tocopherols have been comprehensively characterized in animals and artificial membranes. However, genetic and molecular functions of tocopherols in plants are less understood. This study aimed to isolate a tocopherol-deficient mutant rtd1 in rice. The rtd1 mutant showed overall growth retardation throughout the growth period. Most of the agronomic traits were impaired in rtd1. Map-based cloning revealed that the RTD1 gene encoded a homogentisate phytyltransferase, a key enzyme catalyzing the committed step in tocopherol biosynthesis. RTD1 was preferentially expressed in green leafy tissues, and the protein was located in chloroplasts. Cold tolerance was found to be reduced in rtd1. The cold-related C-repeat-binding factor (CBF)/dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 1 (DREB1) genes were significantly upregulated in rtd1 under natural growth conditions. Moreover, rtd1 exhibited a reduced response to gibberellin (GA).The transcript and protein levels of DELLA protein-coding gene SLENDER RICE 1 (SLR1) in rice was increased in rtd1. However, the GA content was not changed, suggesting a transcriptional, not posttranslational, regulation of SLR1. These findings implied that tocopherols play important roles in regulating rice growth and development.
