OSHB1|LF1	OSHB4|OsHox32	Developmental role and auxin responsiveness of Class III homeodomain leucine zipper gene family members in rice	Four genes, OSHB1 to OSHB4, were expressed in a localized domain of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), the adaxial cells of leaf primordia, the leaf margins, and the xylem tissue of vascular bundles
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OSHB4|OsHox32	The OsmiRNA166b-OsHox32 pair regulates mechanical strength of rice plants by modulating cell wall biosynthesis	 The suppression of OsCAD2 is synergistic when OsHox32 is co-expressed with OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox 15)
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OSHB4|OsHox32	The OsmiRNA166b-OsHox32 pair regulates mechanical strength of rice plants by modulating cell wall biosynthesis	 OsHox32 interacts with OSH15, and the START domain of OsHox32, harbouring the miR166b cleavage site, is required for the interaction of these two proteins
GH2|OsCAD2	OSHB4|OsHox32	The OsmiRNA166b-OsHox32 pair regulates mechanical strength of rice plants by modulating cell wall biosynthesis	 OsHox32 binds to the promoters of OsCAD2 and OsCESA7 to suppress the expression levels of these two genes
