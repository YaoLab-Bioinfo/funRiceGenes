1970.pdf	Rice LHS1/OsMADS1 controls floret meristem specification by coordinated regulation of transcription factors and hormone signaling pathways	2013	Plant Physiol	Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.	SEPALLATA (SEP) MADS box transcription factors mediate floral development in association with other regulators. Mutants in five rice (Oryza sativa) SEP genes suggest both redundant and unique functions in panicle branching and floret development. leafy hull sterile1/OsMADS1, from a grass-specific subgroup of LOFSEP genes, is required for specifying a single floret on the spikelet meristem and for floret organ development, but its downstream mechanisms are unknown. Here, key pathways and directly modulated targets of OsMADS1 were deduced from expression analysis after its knockdown and induction in developing florets and by studying its chromatin occupancy at downstream genes. The negative regulation of OsMADS34, another LOFSEP gene, and activation of OsMADS55, a SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-like floret meristem identity gene, show its role in facilitating the spikelet-to-floret meristem transition. Direct regulation of other transcription factor genes like OsHB4 (a class III homeodomain Leu zipper member), OsBLH1 (a BEL1-like homeodomain member), OsKANADI2, OsKANADI4, and OsETTIN2 show its role in meristem maintenance, determinacy, and lateral organ development. We found that the OsMADS1 targets OsETTIN1 and OsETTIN2 redundantly ensure carpel differentiation. The multiple effects of OsMADS1 in promoting auxin transport, signaling, and auxin-dependent expression and its direct repression of three cytokinin A-type response regulators show its role in balancing meristem growth, lateral organ differentiation, and determinacy. Overall, we show that OsMADS1 integrates transcriptional and signaling pathways to promote rice floret specification and development.
pp1471960.pdf	Developmental role and auxin responsiveness of Class III homeodomain leucine zipper gene family members in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Members of the Class III homeodomain leucine zipper (Class III HD-Zip) gene family are central regulators of crucial aspects of plant development. To better understand the roles of five Class III HD-Zip genes in rice (Oryza sativa) development, we investigated their expression patterns, ectopic expression phenotypes, and auxin responsiveness. Four genes, OSHB1 to OSHB4, were expressed in a localized domain of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), the adaxial cells of leaf primordia, the leaf margins, and the xylem tissue of vascular bundles. In contrast, expression of OSHB5 was observed only in phloem tissue. Plants ectopically expressing microRNA166-resistant versions of the OSHB3 gene exhibited severe defects, including the ectopic production of leaf margins, shoots, and radialized leaves. The treatment of seedlings with auxin quickly induced ectopic OSHB3 expression in the entire region of the SAM, but not in other tissues. Furthermore, this ectopic expression of OSHB3 was correlated with leaf initiation defects. Our findings suggest that rice Class III HD-Zip genes have conserved functions with their homologs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), but have also acquired specific developmental roles in grasses or monocots. In addition, some Class III HD-Zip genes may regulate the leaf initiation process in the SAM in an auxin-dependent manner.
NA	Overexpression of OsHox32 Results in Pleiotropic Effects on Plant Type Architecture and Leaf Development in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	College of Life Sciences, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Animal and Plant Resistance, Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin, 300387, People's Republic of China.	The Class III homeodomain Leu zipper (HD-Zip III) gene family plays important roles in plant growth and development. Here, we analyze the function of OsHox32, an HD-Zip III family member, and show that it exhibits pleiotropic effects on regulating plant type architecture and leaf development in rice.Transgenic lines overexpressing OsHox32 (OsHox32-OV) produce narrow leaves that roll towards the adaxial side. Histological analysis revealed a decreased number of bulliform cells in OsHox32-OV lines. In addition, the angle between the leaf and culm was reduced, resulting in an erect plant phenotype. The height of the plants was reduced, resulting in a semi-dwarf phenotype. In addition, the chlorophyll level was reduced, resulting in a decrease in the photosynthetic rate, but water use efficiency was significantly improved, presumably due to the rolled leaf phenotype. OsHox32 exhibited constitutive expression in different organs, with higher mRNA levels in the stem, leaf sheath, shoot apical meristems and young roots, suggesting a role in plant-type and leaf development. Moreover, OsHox32 mRNA levels were higher in light and lower in the dark under both long-day and short-day conditions, indicating that OsHox32 may be associated with light regulation. Photosynthesis-associated and chlorophyll biosynthesis-associated genes were down-regulated to result in the reduction of photosynthetic capacity in OsHox32-OV lines. mRNA level of six rice YABBY genes is up-regulated or down-regulated by OsHox32, suggesting that OsHox32 may regulate the architecture of plant type and leaf development by controlling the expression of YABBY genes in rice. In addition, OsHox32 mRNA level was induced by the phytohormones, indicating that OsHox32 may be involved in phytohormones regulatory pathways.OsHox32, an HD-Zip III family member, plays pleiotropic effects on plant type architecture and leaf development in rice.
NA	Knock-down of rice microRNA166 confers drought resistance by causing leaf rolling and altering stem xylem development.	2018	Plant Physiol	Shanghai center for plant stress biology CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	microRNAs are 19-22 nt small non-coding RNAs and have been implicated in abiotic stress response. In this study, we found that manipulation of microRNA166 resulted in morphological changes that confer drought resistance in rice. From a large-scale screening for miRNA knock-down lines in rice, we identified miR166 knock-down lines (STTM166) exhibiting a phenotype of leaf rolling, which is normally displayed by rice plants under drought stress. The leaf rolling in STTM166 rice plants was likely due to a reduced size of the bulliform cells and abnormality of sclerenchymatous cells in leaves. The STTM166 plants had reduced stomatal conductance and showed a decreased transpiration rate. The STTM166 lines also exhibited an altered xylem in the stem and a decreased hydraulic conductivity likely due to reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses revealed OsHB4, a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166 and overexpression of miR166-resistant OsHB4 resulted in rice plants resembling the STTM166 lines, including leaf rolling and higher drought resistance. The downstream genes of miR166-OsHB4 consisted of polysaccharides synthesis related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought resistance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem that mimic natural responses of plants to water deficit stress.
NA	The OsmiRNA166b-OsHox32 pair regulates mechanical strength of rice plants by modulating cell wall biosynthesis	2021	Plant Biotechnol J .	Key Laboratory of South China Agricultural Plant Molecular Analysis and Genetic Improvement, and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.	The plant cell wall provides mechanical strength to support plant growth and development and to determine plant architecture. Cellulose and mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) present in primary cell wall, whereas cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose exist in secondary cell wall. Biosynthesis of the cell wall biopolymers needs the coordinated transcriptional regulation of all the biosynthetic genes. The module of OsmiR166b-OsHox32 regulates expression levels of the genes related to biosynthesis of MLG, cellulose and lignin. Transgenic plants knocking down miR166b (STTM166b) by short tandem target mimic (STTM) technology or overexpressing OsHox32 (OEHox32) showed drooping leaves and brittle culms. Due to accumulation of less lignin and cellulose, the cell wall thickness of STTM166b and OEHox32 plants was reduced when compared to that of wild-type plants. Overexpression of miR166b (OE166b) in rice plants or knocking down of OsHox32 by RNA interference (RNAiHox32) led to increased thickness of cell walls and enhanced mechanical strength of culms. Molecular analyses showed that OsmiR166b-OsHox32 pair regulates cell wall-related gene expression. OsHox32 binds to the promoters of OsCAD2 and OsCESA7 to suppress the expression levels of these two genes. The suppression of OsCAD2 is synergistic when OsHox32 is co-expressed with OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox 15). OsHox32 interacts with OSH15, and the START domain of OsHox32, harbouring the miR166b cleavage site, is required for the interaction of these two proteins. Our results demonstrate that OsmiR166b-OsHox32 pair plays important roles not only in plant growth and development but also in plant architecture by regulating the cell wall-related gene expression.
