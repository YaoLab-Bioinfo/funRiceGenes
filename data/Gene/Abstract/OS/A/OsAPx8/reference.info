Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is considered a signal molecule inducing cellular stress. Both heat shock (HS) and Cd can increase H2O2 content. We investigated the involvement of H2O2 in HS- and Cd-mediated changes in the expression of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) in leaves of rice seedlings. HS treatment increased the content of H2O2 before it increased activities of APX and GR in rice leaves. Moreover, HS-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities could be counteracted by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors dipehenylene iodonium (DPI) and imidazole (IMD). HS-induced OsAPX2 gene expression was associated with HS-induced APX activity but was not regulated by H2O2. Cd-increased H2O2 content and APX and GR activities were lower with than without HS. Cd did not increase the expression of OsAPX and OsGR without HS treatment. Cd increased H2O2 content by Cd before it increased APX and GR activities without HS. Treatment with DPI and IMD effectively inhibited Cd-induced H2O2 production and APX and GR activities. Moreover, the effects of DPI and IMD could be rescued with H2O2 treatment. H2O2 may be involved in the regulation of HS- and Cd-increased APX and GR activities in leaves of rice seedlings.
J. Exp. Bot.-2007-Hong-3273-83.pdf	Expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl	2007	J Exp Bot	Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.	Reactive oxygen species are thought to play an important role in NaCl stress. Therefore, the expression patterns of the gene family encoding the H(2)O(2)-scavenging enzyme ascorbate peroxidase (APx; EC1.11.1.11) were analysed in roots of etiolated rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings in response to NaCl stress. Applying semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the mRNA levels were quantified for two cytosolic (OsAPx1 and OsAPx2), two peroxisomal (OsAPx3 and OsAPx4), and four chloroplastic (OsAPx5, OsAPx6, OsAPx7, and OsAPx8) isoforms identified in the rice genome. NaCl at 150 mM and 200 mM increased the expression of OsAPx8 and the activities of APx, but had no effect on the expression of OsAPx1, OsAPx2, OsAPx3, OsAPx4, OsAPx5, OsAPx6, and OsAPx7 in rice roots. However, NaCl at 300 mM up-regulated OsAPx8 expression, increased APx activity, and down-regulated OsAPx7 expression, but had no effect on the expression of OsAPx1, OsAPx2, OsAPx3, OsAPx4, OsAPx5, and OsAPx6. The accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) in response to NaCl was observed in rice roots. Exogenously applied ABA also specifically enhanced the expression of OsAPx8 in rice roots. The accumulation of ABA in rice roots in response to NaCl was inhibited by fluridone (Flu), an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis. Flu treatment also suppressed NaCl-enhanced OsAPx8 expression and APx activity. The effect of Flu on the expression of OsAPx8 and increase in APx activity was reversed by the application of ABA. It appears that NaCl-enhanced expression of OsAPx8 in rice roots is mediated through an accumulation of ABA. Evidence is provided to show that Na(+) but not Cl(-) is required for enhancing OsAPx8 expression, APx activity, and ABA accumulation in rice roots treated with NaCl. H(2)O(2) treatment resulted in an enhancement of OsAPx8 induction but no accumulation of ABA. Diphenylene iodonium treatment, which is known to inhibit NaCl-induced accumulation of H(2)O(2) in rice roots, did not suppress OsAPx8 induction and ABA accumulation by NaCl. It appears that H(2)O(2) is not involved in the regulation of NaCl-induced OsAPx8 expression in rice roots.
psb0303_0199.pdf	NaCl-induced expression of ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE 8 in roots of rice (Oryza sativaL.) seedlings is not associated with osmotic component	2008	Plant Signal Behav	Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Institute of Biotechnology.	Ascorbate peroxidase (APx; EC 1.11.1.11) plays an important role in scavenging the toxic effects of H2O2 in higher plants. Eight types of APx have been described for Oryza sativa: two cytosolic (OsAPx1 and OsAPx2), two putative peroxisomal (OsAPx3 and OsAPx4), and four chloroplastic isoforms (OsAPx5, OsAPx6, OsAPx7, and OsAPx8). We have recently demonstrated that Na+ but not Cl- is required for the NaCl-induced expression of OsAPx8 in rice roots. Evidence is also provided to show that Na+-induced expression of OsAPx8 is mediated through an accumulation of ABA. In addition to its known component of ion toxicity, there is an osmotic effect resulting from salt concentration in the soil. Here we show that ABA level but not OsAPx8 expression was enhanced at a concentration of mannitol iso-osmotic with 150 mM NaCl suggests that NaCl-enhanced OsAPx8 expression is not associated with osmotic component.
NA	The rice thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX8 functions in tolerance to bacterial blight.	2016	Sci Rep	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase (tAPX) is a major H2O2-scavenging enzyme. To clarify its functions in tolerance to rice bacterial blight, we produced rice lines overexpressing and suppressing tAPX (OsAPX8). The overexpressing lines exhibited increased tolerance to bacterial pathogen. The RNA interference (RNAi) lines were considerably more sensitive than the control plant. Further analysis of the H2O2 content in these transgenic plants indicated that the H2O2 accumulation of OsAPX8-overexpressing plants was considerably less than that of wild-type and RNAi plants upon challenge with bacterial pathogen. Interestingly, H2O2 was the most important factor for the serious leaf dehydration and withering of rice without major resistance genes and was not the cause of hypersensitivity. It addition, wall tightening or loosening can occur according to the level of H2O2. In addition, OsAPX8 interacted with the susceptibility protein Os8N3/Xa13, and their binding repressed the reaction of OsAPX8 in tolerance to bacterial blight.
NA	Proteomic and physiological approaches reveal new insights for uncover the role of rice thylakoidal APX in response to drought stress.	2018	J Proteomics	Departamento de Bioqu¨ªmica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal do Cear¨¢, Fortaleza CEP 60451-970, Brazil.	Chloroplast APX isoforms display controversial roles as H2O2 scavengers and signaling players in response to abiotic stress and conclusive results are lacking. We tested the hypothesis that thylakoidal APX displays an important role for drought tolerance, especially by regulating abundance of essential protein species. For this, OsApx8 RNAi-silenced rice (apx8) and non-transformed plants (NT) were exposed to mild water deficit. The drought-sensitivity in apx8 plants was revealed by decreases in shoot growth, relative water content and photosynthesis, which was accompanied by increased membrane damage, all compared to NT plants. This higher sensitivity of apx8 plants to mild drought stress was also related to a lower accumulation of important protein species involved in several metabolic processes, especially photosynthesis, photorespiration and redox metabolism. Despite apx8 plants have displayed an effective induction of compensatory antioxidant mechanisms in well-watered conditions, it was not enough to maintain H2O2 homeostasis and avoid oxidative and physiological disturbances under mild drought conditions. Thus, thylakoidal APX is involved in several phenotypic modifications at proteomic profile level, possibly via a H2O2-induced signaling mechanism. Consequently, this APX isoform is crucial for rice plants effectively cope with a mild drought condition.This work provides for the first time an integrative study involving proteomic, physiological and biochemical analyses directed to elucidation of thylakoidal APX roles for drought tolerance in rice plants. Our data reveal that this enzyme is crucial for maintaining of growth and photosynthesis under mild water deficit conditions. This essential role is related to maintaining of H2O2 homeostasis and accumulation of essential proteins involved in several important metabolic pathways. Remarkably, for drought resistance was essential the accumulation of proteins involved with metabolism of photosynthesis, signaling, carbohydrates, protein synthesis/degradation and stress. These results can contribute to understand the role of chloroplast ascorbate peroxidases in drought tolerance, highlighting the physiological importance of key proteins in this process.
