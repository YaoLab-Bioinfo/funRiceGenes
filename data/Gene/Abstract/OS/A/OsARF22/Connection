HDA710	OsARF22	OsHDA710-mediated Histone Deacetylation Regulates Callus Formation of Rice Mature Embryo.	 Meanwhile, the transcriptional repressors OsARF18 and OsARF22 were upregulated in the callus of hda710
HDA710	OsARF22	OsHDA710-mediated Histone Deacetylation Regulates Callus Formation of Rice Mature Embryo.	 The ChIP-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the callus of hda710 exhibited enhanced histone H3 acetylation levels at the chromatin regions  of OsARF18 and OsARF22
OsARF18	OsARF22	OsHDA710-mediated Histone Deacetylation Regulates Callus Formation of Rice Mature Embryo.	 Meanwhile, the transcriptional repressors OsARF18 and OsARF22 were upregulated in the callus of hda710
