OsARF18	callus	OsHDA710-mediated Histone Deacetylation Regulates Callus Formation of Rice Mature Embryo	 Meanwhile, the transcriptional repressors OsARF18 and OsARF22 were upregulated in the callus of hda710
OsARF18	callus	OsHDA710-mediated Histone Deacetylation Regulates Callus Formation of Rice Mature Embryo	 The ChIP-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the callus of hda710 exhibited enhanced histone H3 acetylation levels at the chromatin regions of OsARF18 and OsARF22
OsARF18	callus	OsHDA710-mediated Histone Deacetylation Regulates Callus Formation of Rice Mature Embryo	 Additionally, overexpression of OsARF18 decreased the transcription of downstream genes PLT1 and PLT2, and inhibited callus formation of mature embryo
