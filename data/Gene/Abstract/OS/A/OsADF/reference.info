In this study, we reported that a F-box protein, OsADF, as one of the direct targets of TDR , plays a critical role in rice tapetum cell development and pollen formation. The tapetum, the innermost sporophytic tissue of anther, plays an important supportive role in male reproduction in flowering plants. After meiosis, tapetal cells undergo programmed cell death (PCD) and provide nutrients for pollen development. Previously we showed that tapetum degeneration retardation (TDR), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, can trigger tapetal PCD and control pollen wall development during anther development. However, the comprehensive regulatory network of TDR remains to be investigated. In this study, we cloned and characterized a panicle-specific expression F-box protein, anther development F-box (OsADF). By qRT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization, we further confirmed that OsADF expressed specially in tapetal cells from stage 9 to stage 12 during anther development. In consistent with this specific expression pattern, the RNAi transgenic lines of OsADF exhibited abnormal tapetal degeneration and aborted microspores development, which eventually grew pollens with reduced fertility. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TDR, a key regulator in controlling rice anther development, could regulate directly the expression of OsADF by binding to E-box motifs of its promoter. Therefore, this work highlighted the possible regulatory role of TDR, which regulates tapetal cell development and pollen formation via triggering the possible ADF-mediated proteolysis pathway.
