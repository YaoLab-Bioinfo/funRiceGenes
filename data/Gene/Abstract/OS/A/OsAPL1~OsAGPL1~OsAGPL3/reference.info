ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) catalyzes the first committed step of starch biosynthesis in higher plants. To identify AGP isoforms essential for this biosynthetic process in sink and source tissues of rice plants, we analyzed the rice AGP gene family which consists of two genes, OsAGPS1 and OsAGPS2, encoding small subunits (SSU) and four genes, OsAGPL1, OsAGPL2, OsAGPL3 and OsAGPL4, encoding large subunits (LSU) of this enzyme heterotetrameric complex. Subcellular localization studies using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs indicate that OsAGPS2a, the product of the leaf-preferential transcript of OsAGPS2, and OsAGPS1, OsAGPL1, OsAGPL3, and OsAGPL4 are plastid-targeted isoforms. In contrast, two isoforms, SSU OsAGPS2b which is a product of a seed-specific transcript of OsAGPS2, and LSU OsAGPL2, are localized in the cytosol. Analysis of osagps2 and osagpl2 mutants revealed that a lesion of one of the two cytosolic isoforms, OsAGPL2 and OsAGPS2b, causes a shrunken endosperm due to a remarkable reduction in starch synthesis. In leaves, however, only the osagps2 mutant appears to severely reduce the transitory starch content. Interestingly, the osagps2 mutant was indistinguishable from wild type during vegetative plant growth. Western blot analysis of the osagp mutants and wild type plants demonstrated that OsAGPS2a is an SSU isoform mainly present in leaves, and that OsAGPS2b and OsAGPL2 are the major SSU and LSU isoforms, respectively, in the endosperm. Finally, we propose a spatiotemporal complex model of OsAGP SSU and LSU isoforms in leaves and in developing endosperm of rice plants.
FP06257.pdf	A mutant of rice lacking the leaf large subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase has drastically reduced leaf starch content but grows normally	2007	Functional Plant Biology	John Innes Centre, Norwich Research Park, Norfolk NR4 7UH, UK. 	A mutant of rice was identified with a Tos17 insertion in OsAPL1, a gene encoding a large subunit (LSU) of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase). The insertion prevents production of a normal transcript from OsAPL1. Characterisation of the mutant (apl1) showed that the LSU encoded by OsAPL1 is required for AGPase activity in rice leaf blades. In mutant leaf blades, the AGPase small subunit protein is not detectable and the AGPase activity and starch content are reduced to <1 and <5% of that in wild type blades, respectively. The mutation also leads to a reduction in starch content in the leaf sheaths but does not significantly affect AGPase activity or starch synthesis in other parts of the plant. The sucrose, glucose and fructose contents of the leaves are not affected by the mutation. Despite the near absence of starch in the leaf blades, apl1 mutant rice plants grow and develop normally under controlled environmental conditions and show no reduction in productivity.
J. Exp. Bot.-2005-Ohdan-3229-44.pdf	Expression profiling of genes involved in starch synthesis in sink and source organs of rice	2005	J Exp Bot	Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), 4-1-8, Honcho, Kawaguchi, Saitama 332-0012, Japan.	A comprehensive analysis of the transcript levels of genes which encode starch-synthesis enzymes is fundamental for the assessment of the function of each enzyme and the regulatory mechanism for starch biosynthesis in source and sink organs. Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, an examination was made of the expression profiles of 27 rice genes encoding six classes of enzymes, i.e. ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), starch synthase, starch branching enzyme, starch debranching enzyme, starch phosphorylase, and disproportionating enzyme in developing seeds and leaves. The modes of gene expression were tissue- and developmental stage-specific. Four patterns of expression in the seed were identified: group 1 genes, which are expressed very early in grain formation and are presumed to be involved in the construction of fundamental cell machineries, de novo synthesis of glucan primers, and initiation of starch granules; group 2 genes, which are highly expressed throughout endosperm development; group 3 genes, which have transcripts that are low at the onset but which rise steeply at the start of starch synthesis in the endosperm and are thought to play essential roles in endosperm starch synthesis; and group 4 genes, which are expressed scantly, mainly at the onset of grain development, and might be involved in synthesis of starch in the pericarp. The methodology also revealed that the defect in the cytosolic AGPase small subunit2b (AGPS2b) transcription from the AGPS2 gene in endosperm sharply enhanced the expressions of endosperm and leaf plastidial AGPS1, the endosperm cytosolic AGPase large subunit2 (AGPL2), and the leaf plastidial AGPL1.
j.1399-3054.2006.00758.x.pdf	Expression profiling of genes related to starch synthesis in rice leaf sheaths during the heading period	2006	Physiologia Plantarum	National Agricultural Research Center, Joetsu, Niigata 943-0193, Japan	The stems (leaf sheaths and culms) of rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) accumulate high levels of starch before heading, which is subsequently remobilized after heading to provide a carbon source for grain filling. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of starch synthesis in rice leaf sheath, a comprehensive expression analysis was conducted on the gene families encoding starch synthesis–related enzymes, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.27), starch synthase (EC 2.4.1.21) and branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.18). The changes in the activities of these enzymes in leaf sheaths during the heading period were shown to be accompanied by a coordinated change in the transcript levels of particular members of the corresponding gene families. A similar change before and after heading was also found in the messenger RNA level of GPT2, one of the two genes encoding for a plastidial glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator, suggesting that the capacity of both starch synthesis and its substrate import is under coordinated transcriptional regulation. The members of the gene families predominantly expressed in leaf sheaths are mostly different from those actively expressed in the developing endosperm. The time course for the transcript level of some of these genes appears to correlate to hexose level in the leaf sheaths, suggesting that hexose levels may be a controlling factor in their expression.
Plant Cell Physiol-2005-Akihiro-937-46.pdf	Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba City, Ibaraki, 305-8572 Japan.	Six cDNA clones encoding two small subunits and four large subunits of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) were mined from the database of rice full-length cDNAs, cloned and subsequently named: OsAPS1, OsAPS2, OsAPL1, OsAPL2, OsAPL3 and OsAPL4. Expression patterns of the six genes were examined by Northern blot analysis with gene-specific probes. OsAPL3 was predominantly expressed in the middle phases of seed development, and OsAPS1, OsAPL1 and OsAPL2 were expressed later in seed development. OsAPS2 and OsAPL4 were constitutively expressed and these isoforms were coordinated with starch accumulation in the developing rice seed. In order to clarify the effect of sugars and plant hormones on AGPase gene expression more precisely, a rice cell culture system was used. OsAPL3 transcript significantly accumulated in response to increased levels of sucrose and abscisic acid (ABA) concentration in the medium; however, the transcripts of other AGPase genes did not show significant accumulation. Under identical conditions, starch contents in the cultured cells also increased. Interestingly, ABA alone did not affect the gene expression of OsAPL3 and starch content. Collectively, these results indicated that the expression level of OsAPL3 and starch content in the cultured cells were cooperatively controlled by alterations in the concentration of both sucrose and ABA.
NA	Two ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase subunits, OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1, modulate phosphorus homeostasis in rice	2020	Plant Journal	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Plant acclimatory responses to phosphate (Pi) starvation stress include the accumulation of carbohydrates, namely sugar and starch. However, whether altered endogenous carbohydrate profile could in turn affect plant Pi starvation responses remains widely unexplored. Here, two genes encoding the large and small subunits of an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) in rice (Oryza sativa), AGP Large Subunit 1 (AGPL1) and AGP Small Subunit 1 (AGPS1), were functionally characterized with regard to maintenance of phosphorus (P) homeostasis and regulation of Pi starvation signaling. AGPL1 and AGPS1 were both positively responsive to nitrogen (N) or Pi deprivation, and expressed in almost all the tissues except in the meristem and mature zones of root. AGPL1 and AGPS1 physically interacted in chloroplast, and catalyzed the rate-limiting step of starch biosynthesis. Low-N- (LN) and low-Pi (LP)-triggered starch accumulation in leaves was impaired in agpl1, agps1 and apgl1 agps1 mutants compared with the wild-type plants. By contrast, mutation of AGPL1 and/or AGPS1 led to an increase in the content of the major sugar, sucrose, in leaf sheath and root under control and LN conditions. Moreover, the Pi accumulation was enhanced in the mutants under control and LN conditions, but not LP conditions. Notably, the LN-induced suppression of Pi accumulation was compromised attributed to the mutation of AGPL1 and/or AGPS1. Furthermore, the increased Pi accumulation was accompanied by the specific suppression of OsSPX2 and activation of several Pi transporter genes. These results indicate that a balanced level of carbohydrates is vital for maintaining plant P homeostasis.
