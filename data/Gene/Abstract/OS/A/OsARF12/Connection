OsARF12	Osspr1	OsARF12, a transcription activator on auxin response gene, regulates root elongation and affects iron accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa)	The knockout of OsARF12 also altered the abundance of mitochondrial iron-regulated (OsMIR), iron (Fe)-regulated transporter1 (OsIRT1) and short postembryonic root1 (OsSPR1) in roots of rice, and resulted in lower Fe content
OsARF12	OsIRT1	OsARF12, a transcription activator on auxin response gene, regulates root elongation and affects iron accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa)	The knockout of OsARF12 also altered the abundance of mitochondrial iron-regulated (OsMIR), iron (Fe)-regulated transporter1 (OsIRT1) and short postembryonic root1 (OsSPR1) in roots of rice, and resulted in lower Fe content
LTN1|OsPHO2|OsRLS1	OsARF12	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2
OsARF12	OsSPX-MFS1|OsPSS1	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2
OsARF12	OsSPX-MFS2	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	Knockout of OsARF12 also influenced the transcript abundances of the OsPHR2 gene and its downstream components, such as OsMiR399j, OsPHO2, OsMiR827, OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2
OsARF12	OsSPX1	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1)--were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions
OsARF12	OsTIR1	Auxin response factor (OsARF12), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa)	Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1)--were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions
OsARF12	OsmiR167a	OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.	 In the overexpression of OsMIR167a plants, the expression of OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25 were severely repressed, and displayed larger tiller angle as well as the osarf12/osarf17 and osarf12/ osarf25 plants
OsARF12	OsmiR167a	OsmiR167a-targeted auxin response factors modulate tiller angle via fine-tuning auxin distribution in rice.	 Our results reveal that OsmiR167a represses its targets, OsARF12, OsARF17 and OsARF25, to control rice tiller angle by fine-tuning auxin asymmetric distribution in shoots
