OsACO2	OsACS2	EAR motif mutation of rice OsERF3 alters the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and drought tolerance	Consistent with our previous research, the expression of ethylene synthesis genes, including ACO2, ACS2, and ACS6 was down-regulated in OE lines
AP37|OsERF3	OsACS2	EAR motif mutation of rice OsERF3 alters the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and drought tolerance	Specifically, ACS2 was up-regulated in mEAR lines compared with that in OE lines and WT plants, suggesting that the Leu/Ala substitution within the EAR motif resulted in loss of repression of OsERF3
OsACS2	OsACS6|SSG6	EAR motif mutation of rice OsERF3 alters the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and drought tolerance	Consistent with our previous research, the expression of ethylene synthesis genes, including ACO2, ACS2, and ACS6 was down-regulated in OE lines
OsACS1	OsACS2	Expression characteristics of OS-ACS1 and OS-ACS2, two members of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Habiganj Aman II) during partial submergence	Herein we have studied the expression characteristics of two members of the five-member multigene family encoding ACC synthase in rice OS-ACS1 and OS-ACS2 and show that partial submergence induces expression of OS-ACS1 and suppresses expression of OS-ACS2
OsACS1	OsACS2	Expression characteristics of OS-ACS1 and OS-ACS2, two members of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Habiganj Aman II) during partial submergence	Expression characteristics of OS-ACS1 and OS-ACS2, two members of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Habiganj Aman II) during partial submergence
OsACS2	OsHI-LOX|OsLOX9	The chloroplast-localized phospholipases D alpha4 and alpha5 regulate herbivore-induced direct and indirect defenses in rice	Antisense expression of OsPLDalpha4 and -alpha5 (as-pld), which resulted in a 50% reduction of the expression of the two genes, reduced elicited levels of linolenic acid, JA, green leaf volatiles, and ethylene and attenuated the SSB-induced expression of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK3), a lipoxygenase (OsHI-LOX), a hydroperoxide lyase (OsHPL3), as well as a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (OsACS2)
OsACS2	OsHPL3	The chloroplast-localized phospholipases D alpha4 and alpha5 regulate herbivore-induced direct and indirect defenses in rice	Antisense expression of OsPLDalpha4 and -alpha5 (as-pld), which resulted in a 50% reduction of the expression of the two genes, reduced elicited levels of linolenic acid, JA, green leaf volatiles, and ethylene and attenuated the SSB-induced expression of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (OsMPK3), a lipoxygenase (OsHI-LOX), a hydroperoxide lyase (OsHPL3), as well as a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (OsACS2)
OsACO7	OsACS2	Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants	Among six ACC synthase (ACS) and seven ACO genes found in the rice genome, OsACS2 was transiently expressed at 48 hpi in IL7 and at 96 hpi in wild type, and OsACO7 was expressed at 48 hpi in IL7
OsACO7	OsACS2	Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants	These findings suggest the importance of ET biosynthesis and, consequently, the coproduct, cyanide, for HR-accompanied resistance to blast fungus in young rice plants and the contribution of induced OsACS2 and OsACO7 gene expression to it
OsACS2	OsHI-LOX|OsLOX9	OsNPR1 negatively regulates herbivore-induced JA and ethylene signaling and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice	The antisense expression of OsNPR1 (as-npr1), which reduced the expression of the gene by 50%, increased elicited levels of JA and ethylene (ET) as well as of expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an ACC synthase gene OsACS2
OsACS2	OsNPR1|NH1	OsNPR1 negatively regulates herbivore-induced JA and ethylene signaling and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice	The antisense expression of OsNPR1 (as-npr1), which reduced the expression of the gene by 50%, increased elicited levels of JA and ethylene (ET) as well as of expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an ACC synthase gene OsACS2
OsACS2	OsETOL1	A homolog of ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER, OsETOL1, differentially modulates drought and submergence tolerance in rice	OsETOL1 was found to interact with OsACS2, a homolog of 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS), which acts as a rate-limiting enzyme for ethylene biosynthesis.
