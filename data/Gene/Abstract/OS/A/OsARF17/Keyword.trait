OsARF17	leaf	SPOC domain-containing protein Leaf inclination3 interacts with LIP1 to regulate rice leaf inclination through auxin signaling.	 Being consistent, transgenic plants with OsIAA12 overexpression or deficiency of OsARF17 which interacts with OsIAA12 do present enlarged leaf inclination
OsARF17	auxin	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.
OsARF17	auxin	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.	 This suggests that OsARF17 plays a crucial role in plant defense against different types of plant viruses, and that these viruses use independently evolved viral proteins to target this key component of auxin signaling and facilitate infection
OsARF17	resistance	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.	 OsARF17 also confers resistance to a cytorhabdovirus and was directly targeted by one of the viral proteins
OsARF17	defense	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.	 This suggests that OsARF17 plays a crucial role in plant defense against different types of plant viruses, and that these viruses use independently evolved viral proteins to target this key component of auxin signaling and facilitate infection
OsARF17	auxin response	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.
OsARF17	R protein	Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor OsARF17 by different plant RNA viruses for infection.	 We show here that two fijiviruses (double-stranded RNA viruses) utilize their proteins to disturb the dimerization of OsARF17 and repress its transcriptional activation ability, while a tenuivirus (negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus) directly interferes with the DNA binding activity of OsARF17
