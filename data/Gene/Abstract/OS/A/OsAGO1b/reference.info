MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small silencing RNAs with regulatory roles in gene expression. miRNAs interact with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to form effector complexes that cleave target mRNAs or repress translation. Rice (Oryza sativa) encodes four AGO1 homologs (AGO1a, AGO1b, AGO1c, and AGO1d). We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the four AGO1s. The RNAi lines displayed pleiotropic developmental phenotypes and had increased accumulation of miRNA targets. AGO1a, AGO1b, and AGO1c complexes were purified and further characterized. The three AGO1s all have a strong preference for binding small RNAs (sRNAs) with 5' U and have Slicer activity. We cataloged the sRNAs in each AGO1 complex by deep sequencing and found that all three AGO1s predominantly bound known miRNAs. Most of the miRNAs were evenly distributed in the three AGO1 complexes, suggesting a redundant role for the AGO1s. Intriguingly, a subset of miRNAs were specifically incorporated into or excluded from one of the AGO1s, suggesting functional specialization among the AGO1s. Furthermore, we identified rice miRNA targets at a global level. The validated targets include transcription factors that control major stages of development and also genes involved in a variety of physiological processes, indicating a broad regulatory role for miRNAs in rice.
NA	Genome-wide identification, organization and phylogenetic analysis of Dicer-like, Argonaute and RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase gene families and their expression analysis during reproductive development and stress in rice.	2008	BMC Genomics	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, New Delhi-110021, India. kapoors@genomeindia.org	Important developmental processes in both plants and animals are partly regulated by genes whose expression is modulated at the post-transcriptional level by processes such as RNA interference (RNAi). Dicers, Argonautes and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDR) form the core components that facilitate gene silencing and have been implicated in the initiation and maintenance of the trigger RNA molecules, central to process of RNAi. Investigations in eukaryotes have revealed that these proteins are encoded by variable number of genes with plants showing relatively higher number in each gene family. To date, no systematic expression profiling of these genes in any of the organisms has been reported.In this study, we provide a complete analysis of rice Dicer-like, Argonaute and RDR gene families including gene structure, genomic localization and phylogenetic relatedness among gene family members. We also present microarray-based expression profiling of these genes during 14 stages of reproductive and 5 stages of vegetative development and in response to cold, salt and dehydration stress. We have identified 8 Dicer-like (OsDCLs), 19 Argonaute (OsAGOs) and 5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (OsRDRs) genes in rice. Based on phylogeny, each of these genes families have been categorized into four subgroups. Although most of the genes express both in vegetative and reproductive organs, 2 OsDCLs, 14 OsAGOs and 3 OsRDRs were found to express specifically/preferentially during stages of reproductive development. Of these, 2 OsAGOs exhibited preferential up-regulation in seeds. One of the Argonautes (OsAGO2) also showed specific up-regulation in response to cold, salt and dehydration stress.This investigation has identified 23 rice genes belonging to DCL, Argonaute and RDR gene families that could potentially be involved in reproductive development-specific gene regulatory mechanisms. These data provide an insight into probable domains of activity of these genes and a basis for further, more detailed investigations aimed at understanding the contribution of individual components of RNA silencing machinery during reproductive phase of plant development.
NA	Overexpression of OsAGO1b Induces Adaxially Rolled Leaves by Affecting Leaf Abaxial Sclerenchymatous Cell Development in Rice.	2019	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1) proteins can recruit small RNAs to regulate gene expression, involving several growth and development processes in Arabidopsis. Rice genome contains four AGO1 genes, OsAGO1a to OsAGO1d. However, the regulatory functions to rice growth and development of each AGO1 gene are still unknown.We obtained overexpression and RNAi transgenic lines of each OsAGO1 gene. However, only up- and down-regulation of OsAGO1b caused multiple abnormal phenotypic changes in rice, indicating that OsAGO1b is the key player in rice growth and organ development compared with other three OsAGO1s. qRT-PCR assays showed that OsAGO1b was almost unanimously expressed in leaves at different developmental stages, and strongly expressed in spikelets at S1 to S3 stages. OsAGO1b is a typical AGO protein, and co-localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm simultaneously. Overexpression of OsAGO1b caused adaxially rolled leaves and a series of abnormal phenotypes, such as the reduced tiller number and plant height. Knockdown lines of OsAGO1b showed almost normal leaves, but the seed setting percentage was significantly reduced accompanied by the disturbed anther patterning and reduced pollen fertility. Further anatomical observation revealed that OsAGO1b overexpression plants showed the partially defective development of sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of leaves. In situ hybridization showed OsAGO1b mRNA was uniformly accumulated in P1 to P3 primordia without polarity property, suggesting OsAGO1b did not regulate the adaxial-abaxial polarity development directly. The expression levels of several genes related to leaf polarity development and vascular bundle differentiation were observably changed. Notably, the accumulation of miR166 and TAS3-siRNA was decreased, and their targeted OSHBs and OsARFs were significantly up-regulated. The mRNA distribution patterns of OSHB3 and OsARF4 in leaves remained almost unchanged between ZH11 and OsAGO1b overexpression lines, but their expression levels were enhanced at the regions of vascular bundles and sclerenchymatous cell differentiation.In summary, we demonstrated OsAGO1b is the leading player among four OsAGO1s in rice growth and development. We propose that OsAGO1b may regulate the abaxial sclerenchymatous cell differentiation by affecting the expression of OSHBs in rice.
