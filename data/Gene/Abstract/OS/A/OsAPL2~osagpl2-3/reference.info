10.1007-s11103-007-9153-z.pdf	Identification of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase isoforms essential for starch synthesis in the leaf and seed endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Graduate School of Biotechnology & Plant Metabolism Research Center, Kyung Hee University, Yongin 446-701, Korea.	ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) catalyzes the first committed step of starch biosynthesis in higher plants. To identify AGP isoforms essential for this biosynthetic process in sink and source tissues of rice plants, we analyzed the rice AGP gene family which consists of two genes, OsAGPS1 and OsAGPS2, encoding small subunits (SSU) and four genes, OsAGPL1, OsAGPL2, OsAGPL3 and OsAGPL4, encoding large subunits (LSU) of this enzyme heterotetrameric complex. Subcellular localization studies using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs indicate that OsAGPS2a, the product of the leaf-preferential transcript of OsAGPS2, and OsAGPS1, OsAGPL1, OsAGPL3, and OsAGPL4 are plastid-targeted isoforms. In contrast, two isoforms, SSU OsAGPS2b which is a product of a seed-specific transcript of OsAGPS2, and LSU OsAGPL2, are localized in the cytosol. Analysis of osagps2 and osagpl2 mutants revealed that a lesion of one of the two cytosolic isoforms, OsAGPL2 and OsAGPS2b, causes a shrunken endosperm due to a remarkable reduction in starch synthesis. In leaves, however, only the osagps2 mutant appears to severely reduce the transitory starch content. Interestingly, the osagps2 mutant was indistinguishable from wild type during vegetative plant growth. Western blot analysis of the osagp mutants and wild type plants demonstrated that OsAGPS2a is an SSU isoform mainly present in leaves, and that OsAGPS2b and OsAGPL2 are the major SSU and LSU isoforms, respectively, in the endosperm. Finally, we propose a spatiotemporal complex model of OsAGP SSU and LSU isoforms in leaves and in developing endosperm of rice plants.
10.1007-s11105-012-0435-5.pdf	Phenotypic and Candidate Gene Analysis of a New Floury Endosperm Mutant (osagpl2-3) in Rice	2012	Plant Molecular Biology Reporter	Agronomy Department, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China	A floury endosperm mutant, osagpl2-3, was isolated from the M2 generation of japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare following ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis. The osagpl2-3 mutant produced a white-core endosperm compared to the transparent endosperm of the wild type (WT). The results from scanning electron microscope showed that the osagpl2-3 mutant grains comprised of round and loosely packed starch granules, some of which were compounded. The analysis for cooking and nutrition quality traits indicated that the values of gel consistency, gelatinization temperature, and rapid viscosity analysis profile of osagpl2-3 grains were lower than those of the WT. Besides, the protein content, the contents of nine different amino acids, and the thermodynamic parameters of T p and ΔT 1/2 in osagpl2-3 were also different from those of the WT. Genetic analysis revealed that osagpl2-3 mutation was controlled by a single recessive gene. The osagpl2-3 gene was mapped between InDel markers R1M30 and ID1-12 on rice chromosome 1. In the candidate region of the Nipponbare genome, an annotated gene, LOC_Os01g44220 which encodes a large subunit of putative ADP-glucose pyrophosphrylase named OsAPL2 was considered the optimal candidate. Cloning and sequencing of LOC_Os01g44220 in different plants of the osagpl2-3 mutants revealed a single nucleotide mutation (G→A) in the open reading frame region, which led to a substitution of an acidic amino acid Glu (E) by a basic amino acid Lys (K) accordingly. Furthermore, the mutant site is close to the functional domain which interacts with the ADP-Glc. In brief, these results suggested that the osagpl2-3 is a new mutant of OsAPL2.

The rice (Oryza sativa L.) basic leucine Zipper factor RISBZ1 and rice prolamin box binding factor (RPBF) are transcriptional activators of rice seed storage protein (SSP) genes in vivo. To ascertain the functions of these trans-activators in seed development, knock-down (KD) transgenic rice plants were generated in which the accumulation of RISBZ1 and RPBF was reduced in an endosperm-specific manner by co-suppression (KD-RISBZ1 and KD-RPBF). The accumulation of most SSPs changed little between individual KD mutants and wild-type plants, whereas a double KD mutant (KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF) resulted in a significant reduction of most SSP gene expression and accumulation. The reduction of both trans-activators also caused a greater reduction in seed starch accumulation than individual KD mutants. Storage lipids were accumulated at reduced levels in KD-RISBZ1 and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF seeds. KD-RPBF and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF seeds exhibited multi-layered aleurone cells. Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF. These phenotypes suggest that combinatorial interactions between RISBZ1 and RPBF play an essential role during grain filling. The functional redundancy and compensation between RISBZ1 and RPBF possibly account for weak effects on the SSP levels in single KD mutants, and help maintain various processes during seed development in rice. Physical interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF may ensure that these processes are carried out properly.
Mol. Plant-2013-Schmidt-mp-sst131.pdf	SALT-RESPONSIVE ERF1 Is a Negative Regulator of Grain Filling and Gibberellin-Mediated Seedling Establishment in Rice	2014	Mol Plant	Institute of Biochemistry and Biology, University of Potsdam, Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 24-25, 14476 Potsdam, Germany	Grain quality is an important agricultural trait that is mainly determined by grain size and composition. Here, we characterize the role of the rice transcription factor (TF) SALT-RESPONSIVE ERF1 (SERF1) during grain development. Through genome-wide expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that SERF1 directly regulates RICE PROLAMIN-BOX BINDING FACTOR (RPBF), a TF that functions as a positive regulator of grain filling. Loss of SERF1 enhances RPBF expression resulting in larger grains with increased starch content, while SERF1 overexpression represses RPBF resulting in smaller grains. Consistently, during grain filling, starch biosynthesis genes such as GRANULE-BOUND STARCH SYNTHASEI (GBSSI), STARCH SYNTHASEI (SSI), SSIIIa, and ADP-GLUCOSE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE LARGE SUBUNIT2 (AGPL2) are up-regulated in SERF1 knockout grains. Moreover, SERF1 is a direct upstream regulator of GBSSI. In addition, SERF1 negatively regulates germination by controlling RPBF expression, which mediates the gibberellic acid (GA)-induced expression of RICE AMYLASE1A (RAmy1A). Loss of SERF1 results in more rapid seedling establishment, while SERF1 overexpression has the opposite effect. Our study reveals that SERF1 represents a negative regulator of grain filling and seedling establishment by timing the expression of RPBF.
Plant Cell Physiol-2005-Akihiro-937-46.pdf	Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba City, Ibaraki, 305-8572 Japan.	Six cDNA clones encoding two small subunits and four large subunits of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) were mined from the database of rice full-length cDNAs, cloned and subsequently named: OsAPS1, OsAPS2, OsAPL1, OsAPL2, OsAPL3 and OsAPL4. Expression patterns of the six genes were examined by Northern blot analysis with gene-specific probes. OsAPL3 was predominantly expressed in the middle phases of seed development, and OsAPS1, OsAPL1 and OsAPL2 were expressed later in seed development. OsAPS2 and OsAPL4 were constitutively expressed and these isoforms were coordinated with starch accumulation in the developing rice seed. In order to clarify the effect of sugars and plant hormones on AGPase gene expression more precisely, a rice cell culture system was used. OsAPL3 transcript significantly accumulated in response to increased levels of sucrose and abscisic acid (ABA) concentration in the medium; however, the transcripts of other AGPase genes did not show significant accumulation. Under identical conditions, starch contents in the cultured cells also increased. Interestingly, ABA alone did not affect the gene expression of OsAPL3 and starch content. Collectively, these results indicated that the expression level of OsAPL3 and starch content in the cultured cells were cooperatively controlled by alterations in the concentration of both sucrose and ABA.
NA	ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit 2 is essential for storage substance accumulation and subunit interactions in rice endosperm	2016	Plant Science	State Key Labor atory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, 1 Weigang Road, Nanjing 210095, China	ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) controls a rate-limiting step in the starch biosynthetic pathway in higher plants. Here we isolated a shrunken rice mutant w24. Map-based cloning identified OsAGPL2, a large subunit of the cytosolic AGPase in rice endosperm, as the gene responsible for the w24 mutation. In addition to severe inhibition of starch synthesis and significant accumulation of sugar, the w24 endosperm showed obvious defects in compound granule formation and storage protein synthesis. The defect in OsAGPL2 enhanced the expression levels of the AGPase family. Meanwhile, the elevated activities of starch phosphorylase 1 and sucrose synthase in the w24 endosperm might possibly partly account for the residual starch content in the mutant seeds. Moreover, the expression of OsAGPL2 and its counterpart, OsAGPS2b, was highly coordinated in rice endosperm. Yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays verified direct interactions between OsAGPL2 and OsAGPS2b as well as OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1, supporting the model for spatiotemporal complex formation of AGPase isoforms in rice endosperm. Besides, our data provided no evidence for the self-binding of OsAGPS2b, implying that OsAGPS2b might not interact to form higher molecular mass aggregates in the absence of OsAGPL2. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of rice AGPase assembly might differ from that of Arabidopsis.

NA	GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 2 regulates grain filling and starch synthesis during rice caryopsis development.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Key Laboratory of Rice Biology and Breeding of Ministry of Agriculture, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	Rice grain filling determines grain weight, final yield and grain quality. Here, a rice defective grain filling mutant, gif2, was identified. Grains of gif2 showed a slower filling rate and a significant lower final grain weight and yield compared to wild-type. The starch content in gif2 was noticeably decreased and its physicochemical properties were also altered. Moreover, gif2 endosperm cells showed obvious defects in compound granule formation. Positional cloning identified GIF2 to encode an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) large subunit, AGPL2; consequently, AGP enzyme activity in gif2 endosperms was remarkably decreased. GIF2 is mainly expressed in developing grains and the coded protein localizes in the cytosol. Yeast two hybrid assay showed that GIF2 interacted with AGP small subunits OsAGPS1, OsAGPS2a and OsAGPS2b. Transcript levels for granule-bound starch synthase, starch synthase, starch branching enzyme and starch debranching enzyme were distinctly elevated in gif2 grains. In addition, the level of nucleotide diversity of the GIF2 locus was extremely low in both cultivated and wild rice. All these results suggest that GIF2 plays important roles in the regulation of grain filling and starch biosynthesis during caryopsis development, and that it has been preserved during selection throughout domestication of modern rice.
NA	CRISPR/Cas9-induced monoallelic mutations in the cytosolic AGPase large subunit gene APL2 induce the ectopic expression of APL2 and the corresponding small subunit gene APS2b in rice leaves.	2018	Transgenic Res	Department of Plant Production and Forestry Science, School of Agrifood and Forestry Science and Engineering (ETSEA), University of Lleida-Agrotecnio Center, Av. Alcalde Rovira Roure 191, 25198, Lleida, Spain.	The first committed step in the endosperm starch biosynthetic pathway is catalyzed by the cytosolic glucose-1-phosphate adenylyl transferase (AGPase) comprising large and small subunits encoded by the OsAPL2 and OsAPS2b genes, respectively. OsAPL2 is expressed solely in the endosperm so we hypothesized that mutating this gene would block starch biosynthesis in the endosperm without affecting the leaves. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create two heterozygous mutants, one with a severely truncated and nonfunctional AGPase and the other with a C-terminal structural modification causing a partial loss of activity. Unexpectedly, we observed starch depletion in the leaves of both mutants and a corresponding increase in the level of soluble sugars. This reflected the unanticipated expression of both OsAPL2 and OsAPS2b in the leaves, generating a complete ectopic AGPase in the leaf cytosol, and a corresponding decrease in the expression of the plastidial small subunit OsAPS2a that was only partially complemented by an increase in the expression of OsAPS1. The new cytosolic AGPase was not sufficient to compensate for the loss of plastidial AGPase, most likely because there is no wider starch biosynthesis pathway in the leaf cytosol and because pathway intermediates are not shuttled between the two compartments.
