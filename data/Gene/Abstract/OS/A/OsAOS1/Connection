OsAOS1	OsHI-LOX|OsLOX9	OsMPK3 positively regulates the JA signaling pathway and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice	Silencing OsMPK3 (ir-mpk3) reduced the expression of the gene by 50-70 %, decreased elicited levels of JA and diminished the expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an allene oxide synthase gene OsAOS1
OsAOS1	OsAOS4|OsHPL1	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots
OsAOS1	OsAOS4|OsHPL1	Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings	The response in OsAOS1 transcripts occurred rapidly and transiently, while the response in OsAOS4 transcripts was slower and more sustainable; the maximal enhancement was greater in OsAOS1 transcripts than in OsAOS4 transcripts
OsAOS1	OsDof24	Rice DNA-BINDING ONE ZINC FINGER 24 (OsDOF24) Delays Leaf Senescence in a Jasmonate-Mediated Pathway.	 Yeast one-hybrid assays showed that OsDOF24 binds to the promoter region of OsAOS1
