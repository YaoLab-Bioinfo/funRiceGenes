tpj5122.pdf	OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice	2012	The Plant Journal	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Nitrogen is a crucial nutrient for plant growth and development. Arginine is considered an important amino acid for nitrogen transport and storage, playing a crucial role during plant seedling development. However, little is known about the role of arginine in nitrogen remobilization at the reproductive stage. We isolated a rice mutant with reduced plant height, small panicle and grain size, and low seed-setting rate (10% in nglf-1 compared to 93% in wild-type). Map-based cloning revealed that the mutant was caused by the loss of function of a gene (OsARG) encoding an arginine hydrolysis enzyme, which is consistent with arginine accumulation in the mutant. The phenotype was partially corrected supplying exogenous nitrogen, and fully corrected by a wild type OsARG transgene. Overexpression of OsARG in rice (var. Kitaake) increased grain number per plant under nitrogen-limited conditions. OsARG, ubiquitously expressed in various organs, was more strongly expressed in the developing panicles. The OsARG protein was localized in the mitochondria, consistent with other arginases. Our results suggest that the arginase encoded by OsARG, a key enzyme in Arg catabolism, plays a critical role during panicle development, especially under conditions of insufficient exogenous nitrogen. OsARG is a potential target for crop improvement.
NA	Expression of the Rice Arginase Gene OsARG in Cotton Influences the Morphology and Nitrogen Transition of Seedlings.	2015	PLoS One	Biotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Arginase is the only enzyme capable of producing urea in plants. This enzyme also contributes to many important biological functions during plant growth and development, such as seed development, root development and plant nitrogen using. The unique rice arginase gene OsARG is known to affect nitrogen use efficiency and is also associated with higher yields in rice. In this study, we transformed OsARG into upland cotton R18 by Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation and analyzed the function of OsARG in transgenic cotton. Two independent OsARG expression transgenic cotton lines, ARG-26 and ARG-38, were obtained via transformation. Southern blot analysis indicated that two copies and one copy of the OsARG gene were integrated into the ARG-26 and ARG-38 genomes, respectively. Enzyme activity and RNA transcription analysis revealed that the OsARG gene is highly expressed in cotton. The nitric oxide content and the morphology of ARG-26 and ARG-38 seedlings were both affected by expression of the OsARG gene. Field experiments indicated that the polyamine and nitrogen content increased by more than two-fold in the T3 generation plants of the transgenic cotton lines ARG-26-2, ARG-26-7, ARG-38-8, and ARG-38-11, as compared with the control plants. After harvesting cotton fibers grown in field conditions, we analyzed the quality of fiber and found that the fiber length was increased in the transgenic lines. The average cotton fiber length for all of the transgenic cotton lines was two millimeters longer than the fibers of the control plants; the average cotton fiber lengths were 31.94 mm, 32.00 mm, 32.68 mm and 32.84 mm in the ARG-26ARG-26-2, ARG-26-7, ARG-38-8 and ARG-38-11 lines, respectively, but the average fiber length of the control plants was 29.36mm. Our results indicate that the OsARG gene could potentially be used to improve cotton fiber length traits.
NA	Loss of Function of OsARG Resulted in Pepper-Shaped Husk in Indica Rice	2021	Life (Basel)	College of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China.	Grain shape is one of the most important and complex traits determining the grain yield in rice. In this study, we discovered two rice mutants with defective shape spikelets, designated as psh1-1/2 (pepper-shaped husk 1-1/2), which were both isolated from the tissue-culture-regenerated plants of indica cultivar Minghui 86. The two mutants showed the same mutant phenotypes, containing pepper-shaped spikelets; shorter, smaller and compact panicles; very low seed-setting rate; high percentage of split grains; and lower grain width. Genetic analysis indicated that the mutant phenotypes were controlled by a recessive gene. Gene mapping indicated that the target gene PSH1 was located on the short arm of chromosome 4. Sequencing analysis revealed that the two mutants each had a different nonsense mutation in OsARG, confirming that the target gene is OsARG. Compared with the previously reported OsARG mutant nglf-1, psh1-1/2 possessed some distinct mutant phenotypes, probably because of the influence of different genetic background, suggesting that OsARG may function differently under different genetic backgrounds.
