OsAMT1;1|OsAMT1.1	OsAMT1;3|OsAMT1.3	Distinct expression and function of three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1-1;3) in rice	Northern blot analysis showed a distinct expression pattern for the three genes; more constitutive expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1, root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2, and root-specific and nitrogen-derepressible expression for OsAMT1;3
OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	OsAMT1;3|OsAMT1.3	Distinct expression and function of three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1-1;3) in rice	Northern blot analysis showed a distinct expression pattern for the three genes; more constitutive expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1, root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2, and root-specific and nitrogen-derepressible expression for OsAMT1;3
OsAMT1;3|OsAMT1.3	OsPTR6|PTR6|OsNPF7.3	Over-expression of OsPTR6 in rice increased plant growth at different nitrogen supplies but decreased nitrogen use efficiency at high ammonium supply	The expression of OsATM1 genes in over-expression lines showed that the OsPTR6 over expression increased OsAMT1.1, OsATM1.2 and OsAMT1.3 expression at 0.2 and 5.0mmol/L NH4(+) and 2.5mmol/L NH4NO3
OsAMT1;3|OsAMT1.3	OsDOF18	Transcription Factor OsDOF18 Controls Ammonium Uptake by Inducing Ammonium Transporters in Rice Roots.	 Among the 10 ammonium transporter genes examined here, expression of OsAMT1;1,<U+00A0>OsAMT1;3, OsAMT2;1, and OsAMT4;1 was reduced in osdof18 mutants, demonstrating that the ammonium transporter genes function downstream of OsDOF18
OsAMT1;1|OsAMT1.1	OsAMT1;3|OsAMT1.3	Three polarly localized ammonium transporter 1 members are cooperatively responsible for ammonium uptake in rice under low ammonium condition	 Spatial expression analysis showed that the upregulated expression of OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2 and downregulated expression of OsAMT1;3 by ammonium were higher in the root mature region than in the root tips
