OsAGAP	primary root	OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP from rice, regulates root development mediated by auxin in Arabidopsis	Transgenic Arabidopsis with OsAGAP constitutively expression showed reduced apical dominance, shorter primary roots, increasing number of longer adventitious roots
OsAGAP	root	Over-expression of OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP, interferes with auxin influx, vesicle trafficking and root development	Here, we show that over-expression of OsAGAP, an ARF-GTPase-activating protein (ARF-GAP) in rice, impaired PAT and interfered with both primary and lateral root development
OsAGAP	root	Over-expression of OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP, interferes with auxin influx, vesicle trafficking and root development	Together, our data suggest that OsAGAP has a specific role in regulating vesicle trafficking pathways such as the auxin influx pathway, which in turn controls auxin-dependent root growth in plants
OsAGAP	root	Over-expression of OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP, interferes with auxin influx, vesicle trafficking and root development	Over-expression of OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP, interferes with auxin influx, vesicle trafficking and root development
OsAGAP	seedling	OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP from rice, regulates root development mediated by auxin in Arabidopsis	Determination of whole-plant IAA level showed that there is a sharp increase of free IAA in OsAGAP transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings
OsAGAP	root development	OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP from rice, regulates root development mediated by auxin in Arabidopsis	These results suggest OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP of rice, maybe involved in the mediation of plant root development by regulating auxin level

OsAGAP	iaa	OsAGAP, an ARF-GAP from rice, regulates root development mediated by auxin in Arabidopsis	Determination of whole-plant IAA level showed that there is a sharp increase of free IAA in OsAGAP transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings
OsAGAP	auxin	Adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-GTPase-activating protein stimulates the transport of AUX1 endosome, which relies on actin cytoskeletal organization in rice root development	Thus, we propose that AUX1 accumulation in the OsAGAP overexpression and actin disrupted cells may be due to the fact that endocytosis of the auxin influx carrier AUX1 early endosome was greatly promoted by actin cytoskeleton disruption
