OsAMT1;1|OsAMT1.1	OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	Feedback regulation of the ammonium transporter gene family AMT1 by glutamine in rice	The three members of the rice OsAMT1 gene family of ammonium transporters show distinct expression patterns; constitutive and ammonium-promoted expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1; root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2; root-specific and nitrogen-repressible expression for OsAMT1;3 [Sonoda et al

OsAMT1;1|OsAMT1.1	OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	Feedback regulation of the ammonium transporter gene family AMT1 by glutamine in rice	The expression patterns of the three genes showed good correlation (positive in OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2, negative in OsAMT1;3) with the root tissue contents of glutamine but not of ammonium
OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	OsAMT1;3|OsAMT1.3	Feedback regulation of the ammonium transporter gene family AMT1 by glutamine in rice	The three members of the rice OsAMT1 gene family of ammonium transporters show distinct expression patterns; constitutive and ammonium-promoted expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1; root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2; root-specific and nitrogen-repressible expression for OsAMT1;3 [Sonoda et al

OsAMT1;1|OsAMT1.1	OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	Distinct expression and function of three ammonium transporter genes (OsAMT1;1-1;3) in rice	Northern blot analysis showed a distinct expression pattern for the three genes; more constitutive expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1, root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2, and root-specific and nitrogen-derepressible expression for OsAMT1;3

OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	OsPTR6|PTR6|OsNPF7.3	Over-expression of OsPTR6 in rice increased plant growth at different nitrogen supplies but decreased nitrogen use efficiency at high ammonium supply	The expression of OsATM1 genes in over-expression lines showed that the OsPTR6 over expression increased OsAMT1.1, OsATM1.2 and OsAMT1.3 expression at 0.2 and 5.0mmol/L NH4(+) and 2.5mmol/L NH4NO3
OsACTPK1	OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	Lack of ACTPK1, an STY kinase, enhances ammonium uptake and use and promotes growth of rice seedlings under sufficient external ammonium.	 Root cellular expression of OsACTPK1 also overlapped with that of ammonium-induced OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2
