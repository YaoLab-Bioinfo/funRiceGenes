OsAMT1;1|OsAMT1.1	OsAMT1;2|OsAMT1.2	Feedback regulation of the ammonium transporter gene family AMT1 by glutamine in rice	The three members of the rice OsAMT1 gene family of ammonium transporters show distinct expression patterns; constitutive and ammonium-promoted expression in shoots and roots for OsAMT1;1; root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2; root-specific and nitrogen-repressible expression for OsAMT1;3 [Sonoda et al

Among the 10 ammonium transporter genes examined here, expression of OsAMT1;1,<U+00A0>OsAMT1;3, OsAMT2;1, and OsAMT4;1 was reduced in osdof18 mutants, demonstrating that the ammonium transporter genes function downstream of OsDOF18
OsACTPK1	OsAMT1;1|OsAMT1.1	Lack of ACTPK1, an STY kinase, enhances ammonium uptake and use and promotes growth of rice seedlings under sufficient external ammonium.	 Root cellular expression of OsACTPK1 also overlapped with that of ammonium-induced OsAMT1;1 and OsAMT1;2
