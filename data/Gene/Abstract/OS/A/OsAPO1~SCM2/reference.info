We report a recessive mutation of rice, aberrant panicle organization 1 (apo1), which severely affects inflorescence architecture, floral organ identity, and leaf production rate. In the wild-type inflorescence, the main-axis meristem aborts after forming 10-12 primary branch primordia. However, in apo1, the main-axis meristem was converted to a spikelet meristem after producing a small number of branch primordia. In addition, the branch meristems in apo1 became spikelet meristems earlier than in wild type. Therefore, in the inflorescence, the apo1 mutation caused the precocious conversion of the meristem identity. In the apo1 flower, lodicules were increased at the expense of stamens, and carpels were formed indeterminately by the loss of meristem determinacy. Vegetative development is also affected in the apo1. Leaves were formed rapidly throughout the vegetative phase, indicating that APO1 is also involved in temporal regulation of leaf production. These phenotypes suggest that the APO1 plays an important role in the temporal regulation of both vegetative and reproductive development.
10.1007-s00122-009-1218-8.pdf	A gene controlling the number of primary rachis branches also controls the vascular bundle formation and hence is responsible to increase the harvest index and grain yield in rice	2010	Theor Appl Genet	Rice Physiology Research Sub-Team, Hokuriku Research Center, National Agricultural Research Center, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 1-2-1, Inada, Joetsu, Niigata, 943-0193, Japan. terao@affrc.go.jp	The quantitative trait locus controlling the number of primary rachis branches (PRBs) in rice was identified using backcrossed inbred lines of Sasanishiki/Habataki//Sasanishiki///Sasanishiki. The resultant gene was ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 (APO1). Habataki-genotype segregated reciprocal recombinant lines for the APO1 locus increased both the number of PRB (12-13%) and the number of grains per panicle (9-12%), which increased the grain yield per plant (5-7%). Further recombination dividing this region revealed that different alleles regulated the number of PRB and the number of grains per panicle. The PRB1 allele, which includes the APO1 open reading frame (ORF) and the proximal promoter region, controlled only the number of PRB but not the number of grains per panicle. In contrast, the HI1 allele, which includes only the distal promoter region, increased the grain yield and harvest index in Habataki-genotype plants, nevertheless, the ORF expressed was Sasanishiki type. It also increased the number of large vascular bundles in the peduncle. APO1 expression occurred not only in developing panicles but also in the developing vascular bundle systems. In addition, Habataki plants displayed increased APO1 expression in comparison to Sasanishiki plants. It suggests that APO1 enhances the formation of vascular bundle systems which, consequently, promote carbohydrate translocation to panicles. The HI1 allele is suggested to regulate the amount of APO1 expression, and thereby control the development of vascular bundle systems. These findings may be useful to improve grain yield as well as quality through the improvement of translocation efficiency.
j.1365-313X.2007.03200.x.pdf	Rice ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1, encoding an F-box protein, regulates meristem fate	2007	Plant J	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Inflorescence architecture is one of the most important agronomical traits. Characterization of rice aberrant panicle organization 1 (apo1) mutants revealed that APO1 positively controls spikelet number by suppressing the precocious conversion of inflorescence meristems to spikelet meristems. In addition, APO1 is associated with the regulation of the plastchron, floral organ identity, and floral determinacy. Phenotypic analyses of apo1 and floral homeotic double mutants demonstrate that APO1 positively regulates class-C floral homeotic genes, but not class-B genes. Molecular studies revealed that APO1 encodes an F-box protein, an ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGAN (UFO), which is a positive regulator of class-B genes. Overexpression of APO1 caused an increase in inflorescence branches and spikelets. As the mutant inflorescences and flowers differed considerably between apo1 and ufo, the functions of APO1 and UFO appear to have diverged during evolution.
j.1365-313X.2011.04781.x.pdf	ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1	2012	Plant J	Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Yayoi, Bunkyo, Tokyo 113-0032, Japan.	The temporal and spatial control of meristem identity is a key element in plant development. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate inflorescence and flower architecture, we characterized the rice aberrant panicle organization 2 (apo2) mutant which exhibits small panicles with reduced number of primary branches due to the precocious formation of spikelet meristems. The apo2 mutants also display a shortened plastochron in the vegetative phase, late flowering, aberrant floral organ identities and loss of floral meristem determinacy. Map-based cloning revealed that APO2 is identical to previously reported RFL gene, the rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis LEAFY (LFY) gene. Further analysis indicated that APO2/RFL and APO1, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, act cooperatively to control inflorescence and flower development. The present study revealed functional differences between APO2/RFL and LFY. In particular, APO2/RFL and LFY act oppositely on inflorescence development. Therefore, the genetic mechanisms for controlling inflorescence architecture have evolutionarily diverged between rice (monocots) and Arabidopsis (eudicots).
ncomms1132.pdf	New approach for rice improvement using a pleiotropic QTL gene for lodging resistance and yield	2010	Nat Commun	Graduate School of Agriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo 183-8509, Japan.	The use of fertilizer results in tall rice plants that are susceptible to lodging and results in reduced plant yields. In this study, using chromosome segment substitution lines, we identified an effective quantitative trait loci (QTL) for culm strength, which was designated STRONG CULM2 (SCM2). Positional cloning of the gene revealed that SCM2 was identical to ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1), a gene previously reported to control panicle structure. A near-isogenic line carrying SCM2 showed enhanced culm strength and increased spikelet number because of the pleiotropic effects of the gene. Although SCM2 is a gain-of-function mutant of APO1, it does not have the negative effects reported for APO1 overexpression mutants, such as decreased panicle number and abnormal spikelet morphology. The identification of lodging-resistance genes by QTL analysis combined with positional cloning is a useful approach for improving lodging resistance and overall productivity in rice.
Plant Physiol.-2009-Ikeda-Kawakatsu-736-47.pdf	Expression level of ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 determines rice inflorescence form through control of cell proliferation in the meristem	2009	Plant Physiol	Research Institute for Bioresources, Okayama University, Kurashiki, Okayama 710-0046, Japan.	Two types of branches, rachis branches (i.e. nonfloral) and spikelets (i.e. floral), are produced during rice (Oryza sativa) inflorescence development. We previously reported that the ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1) gene, encoding an F-box-containing protein orthologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, suppresses precocious conversion of rachis branch meristems to spikelets to ensure generation of certain number of spikelets. Here, we identified four dominant mutants producing an increased number of spikelets and found that they are gain-of-function alleles of APO1. The APO1 expression levels are elevated in all four mutants, suggesting that an increase of APO1 activity caused the delay in the program shift to spikelet formation. In agreement with this result, ectopic overexpression of APO1 accentuated the APO1 gain-of-function phenotypes. In the apo1-D dominant alleles, the inflorescence meristem starts to increase in size more vigorously than the wild type when switching to the reproductive development phase. This alteration in growth rate is opposite to what is observed with the apo1 mutants that have a smaller inflorescence meristem. The difference in meristem size is caused by different rates of cell proliferation. Collectively, these results suggest that the level of APO1 activity regulates the inflorescence form through control of cell proliferation in the meristem.
NA	Ozone-Induced Rice Grain Yield Loss Is Triggered via a Change in Panicle Morphology That Is Controlled by ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 Gene.	2015	PLoS One	Center for Environmental Biology and Ecosystem, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8506, Japan; Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8577, Japan.	Rice grain yield is predicted to decrease in the future because of an increase in tropospheric ozone concentration. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated the responses to ozone of two rice (Oryza Sativa L.) cultivars, Sasanishiki and Habataki. Sasanishiki showed ozone-induced leaf injury, but no grain yield loss. By contrast, Habataki showed grain yield loss with minimal leaf injury. A QTL associated with grain yield loss caused by ozone was identified in Sasanishiki/Habataki chromosome segment substitution lines and included the ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 (APO1) gene. The Habataki allele of the APO1 locus in a near-isogenic line also resulted in grain yield loss upon ozone exposure, suggesting APO1 involvement in ozone-induced yield loss. Only a few differences in the APO1 amino acid sequences were detected between the cultivars, but the APO1 transcript level was oppositely regulated by ozone exposure: i.e., it increased in Sasanishiki and decreased in Habataki. Interestingly, the levels of some phytohormones (jasmonic acid, jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine, and abscisic acid) known to be involved in attenuation of ozone-induced leaf injury tended to decrease in Sasanishiki but to increase in Habataki upon ozone exposure. These data indicate that ozone-induced grain yield loss in Habataki is caused by a reduction in the APO1 transcript level through an increase in the levels of phytohormones that reduce leaf damage.
NA	The LARGE2-APO1/APO2 regulatory module controls panicle size and grain number in rice	2021	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering, CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Plant Science, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Panicle size and grain number are important agronomic traits and influence grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa), but the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying panicle size and grain number control remain largely unknown in crops. Here we report that LARGE2 encodes a HECT-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase OsUPL2 and regulates panicle size and grain number in rice. The loss of function large2 mutants produce large panicles with increased grain number, wide grains and leaves, and thick culms. LARGE2 regulates panicle size and grain number by repressing meristematic activity. LARGE2 is highly expressed in young panicles and grains. Biochemical analyses show that LARGE2 physically associates with ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1) and APO2, two positive regulators of panicle size and grain number, and modulates their stabilities. Genetic analyses support that LARGE2 functions with APO1 and APO2 in a common pathway to regulate panicle size and grain number. These findings reveal a novel genetic and molecular mechanism of the LARGE2-APO1/APO2 module-mediated control of panicle size and grain number in rice, suggesting that this module is a promising target for improving panicle size and grain number in crops.
