To unravel the mechanisms of K+ uptake and its sensitivity to salt stress in the model plant rice, we isolated and functionally characterized OsAKT1, a potassium channel homologous to the Arabidopsis root inward rectifier AKT1. OsAKT1 transcripts were predominantly found in the coleoptile and in the roots of young rice seedlings. K+ channel mRNA decreases in response to salt stress, both in the shoot and in the root of 4-day-old rice seedlings. Following expression in HEK293 cells, we were able to characterize OsAKT1 as a voltage-dependent, inward-rectifying K+ channel regulated by extracellular Ca2+ and protons. Patch-clamp studies on rice root protoplasts identified a K+ inward rectifier with similar channel properties as heterologously expressed OsAKT1. In line with the transcriptional downregulation of OsAKT1 in response to salt stress, inward K+ currents were significantly reduced in root protoplasts. Thus, OsAKT1 seems to represent the dominant salt-sensitive K+ uptake channel in rice roots.
NA	The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex	2014	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Biological Sciences, National Plant Gene Research Centre (Beijing), China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Potassium (K+) is one of the essential nutrient elements for plant growth and development. Plants absorb K+ ions from the environment via root cell K+ channels and/or transporters. In this study, the Shaker K+ channel Os-AKT1 was characterized for its function in K+ uptake in rice (Oryza sativa) roots, and its regulation by Os-CBL1 (Calcineurin B-Like protein1) and Os-CIPK23 (CBL-Interacting Protein Kinase23) was investigated. As an inward K+ channel, Os-AKT1 could carry out K+ uptake and rescue the low-K+-sensitive phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana akt1 mutant plants. Rice Os-akt1 mutant plants showed decreased K+ uptake and displayed an obvious low-K+-sensitive phenotype. Disruption of Os-AKT1 significantly reduced the K+ content, which resulted in inhibition of plant growth and development. Similar to the AKT1 regulation in Arabidopsis, Os-CBL1 and Os-CIPK23 were identified as the upstream regulators of Os-AKT1 in rice. The Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex could enhance Os-AKT1-mediated K+ uptake. A phenotype test confirmed that Os-CIPK23 RNAi lines exhibited similar K+-deficient symptoms as the Os-akt1 mutant under low K+ conditions. These findings demonstrate that Os-AKT1-mediated K+ uptake in rice roots is modulated by the Os-CBL1-Os-CIPK23 complex.
NA	Overexpression of the rice AKT1 potassium channel affects potassium nutrition and rice drought tolerance.	2016	J Exp Bot	Department of Biology, University of York, York YO10 5DD, UK.	Potassium (K(+)) is the most important cationic nutrient for all living organisms and has roles in most aspects of plant physiology. To assess the impact of one of the main K(+) uptake components, the K(+) inward rectifying channel AKT1, we characterized both loss of function and overexpression of OsAKT1 in rice. In many conditions, AKT1 expression correlated with K(+) uptake and tissue K(+) levels. No salinity-related growth phenotype was observed for either loss or gain of function mutants. However, a correlation between AKT1 expression and root Na(+) when the external Na/K ratio was high suggests that there may be a role for AKT1 in Na(+) uptake in such conditions. In contrast to findings with Arabidopsis thaliana, we did not detect any change in growth of AKT1 loss of function mutants in the presence of NH4 (+). Nevertheless, NH4 (+)-dependent inhibition was detected during K(+) uptake assays in loss of function and wild type plants, depending on pre-growth conditions. The most prominent result of OsAKT1 overexpression was a reduction in sensitivity to osmotic/drought stress in transgenic plants: the data suggest that AKT1 overexpression improved rice osmotic and drought stress tolerance by increasing tissue levels of K(+), especially in the root.
NA	Potassium Ion Channel Gene OsAKT1 Affects Iron Translocation in Rice Plants Exposed to Iron Toxicity.	2019	Front Plant Sci	Department of Plant Nutrition, Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.	Iron toxicity is one of the most widely spread mineral disorders in anaerobic soils, but the tolerance mechanisms in plants are poorly understood. Here we characterize the involvement of a rice potassium ion channel gene, OsAKT1, in Fe toxic conditions. Two knock-down lines of OsAKT1 together with azygos lines were investigated. Mutant lines did not differ from azygos lines regarding plant growth, gas exchange rate or chlorophyll fluorescence in control conditions. However, loss-of-function of OsAKT1 increased the sensitivity to excess Fe regarding leaf bronzing symptoms, reactive oxygen species generation, leaf spectral reflectance indices, and chlorophyll fluorescence. Fe toxicity leads to largely reduced uptake of other nutrients into shoots, which illustrates the complexity of Fe stress related to multiple mineral disorders. Less potassium uptake in the mutants compared to azygos lines co-occurred with higher amounts of Fe accumulated in the shoot tissues but not in the roots. These results were consistent with a higher level of Fe loaded into the xylem sap of mutants compared to azygos lines in the early phase of Fe toxicity. In conclusion, OsAKT1 is crucial for the tolerance of rice against Fe toxicity as K homeostasis affects Fe translocation from root to shoot.
NA	Calcium lignosulfonate improves proliferation of recalcitrant indica rice callus via modulation of auxin biosynthesis and enhancement of nutrient absorption	2021	Plant Physiol Biochem	Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia. Electronic address: wanmuhamadasrul@gmail.com.	Lignosulfonate (LS) is a commonly used to promote plant growth. However, the underlying growth promoting responses of LS in plant remain unknown. Therefore, this study was undertaken to elucidate the underlying growth promoting mechanisms of LS, specifically calcium lignosulfonate (CaLS). Addition of 100 mg/L CaLS in phytohormone-free media enhanced recalcitrant indica rice cv. MR219 callus proliferation rate and adventitious root formation. Both, auxin related genes (OsNIT1, OsTAA1 and OsYUC1) and tryptophan biosynthesis proteins were upregulated in CaLS-treated calli which corroborated with increased of endogenous auxin content. Moreover, increment of OsWOX11 gene on CaLS-treated calli implying that the raised of endogenous auxin was utilized as a cue to enhance adventitious root development. Besides, CaLS-treated calli showed higher nutrient ions content with major increment in calcium and potassium ions. Consistently, increased of potassium protein kinases genes (OsAKT1, OsHAK5, OsCBL, OsCIPK23 and OsCamk1) were also recorded. In CaLS treated calli, the significant increase of calcium ion was observed starting from week one while potassium ion only recorded significant increase on week two onwards, suggesting that increment of potassium ion might be dependent on the calcium ion content in the plant cell. Additionally, reduced callus blackening was also coherent with downregulation of ROS scavenging protein and reduced H2O2 content in CaLS-treated calli suggesting the role of CaLS in mediating cellular homeostasis via prevention of oxidative burst in the cell. Taken together, CaLS successfully improved MR219 callus proliferation and root formation by increasing endogenous auxin synthesis, enhancing nutrients uptake and regulating cellular homeostasis.
NA	Silicon alleviates salt stress-induced potassium deficiency by promoting potassium uptake and translocation in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2021	J Plant Physiol	Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Environment Remediation and Ecological Health, College of Environmental & Resource Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China.	Under salt stress, plants suffer from potassium (K) deficiency caused by excess salts in growth substrate. Silicon (Si) can promote K status in many plant species under salt stress, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the effects of Si on K homeostasis in rice under salt stress and investigated the mechanisms behind using two low-Si rice mutants (lsi1 and lsi2) and their wild types (WTs). After five days' treatment with Si, plant growth was improved and salt stress-induced K deficiency was alleviated in WTs but not in mutants. Simultaneously, Si significantly enhanced K accumulation content, K uptake index and shoot K distribution rate in WTs but not in mutants. Besides, Si enhanced K concentration in xylem sap in WTs but not in mutants. Scanning ion-selected electrode technique (SIET) analysis showed net K influx rate was raised by Si addition under salt stress in WTs but not in mutants. Moreover, Si up-regulated the expression of genes responsible for K uptake (OsAKT1 and OsHAK1) and xylem loading (OsSKOR) in WTs but not in mutants. Overall, our results strongly indicate that Si can improve K uptake and translocation by up-regulating the expression of relevant genes, thereby promoting K status and alleviating salt stress in rice.
