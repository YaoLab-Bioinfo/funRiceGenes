OsAns	OsDfr|OsA1	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	The role of the regulatory gene OsC1-Myb, encoding a MYB class of transcription activators in the stress-induced expression of the structural genes, OsDfr and OsAns, was analyzed
OsAns	OsDfr|OsA1	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	indica) seedlings under dehydration stress or high salt or abscisic acid (ABA) showed a significant enhancement of transcript level and/or transcript stability of OsDfr and OsAns
OsAns	OsDfr|OsA1	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	The expression pattern of these three genes indicates that the stress responsive accumulation of OsDfr and OsAns transcripts is mediated by the transcription factor, OsC1-MYB
OsAns	OsDfr|OsA1	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	The 5' upstream region of the OsDfr and OsAns genes carry several regulatory domains, which share homology with some of the known stress responsive genes in plants
OsAns	OsDfr|OsA1	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	In addition, several putative myb and myc responsive domains were identified in the promoter region of the genes, OsDfr and OsAns
OsAns	OsDfr|OsA1	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	The recombinant OsC1-MYB protein binds in vitro to the myb responsive elements (MREs) in the OsDfr and OsAns promoters, suggesting that it is a potential transcription activator of stress-induced expression of structural genes of the flavonoid pathway
OsAns	OsDfr|OsA1	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB	Rice flavonoid pathway genes, OsDfr and OsAns, are induced by dehydration, high salt and ABA, and contain stress responsive promoter elements that interact with the transcription activator, OsC1-MYB
