NA	OsAGO2 controls ROS production and the initiation of tapetal PCD by epigenetically regulating OsHXK1 expression in rice anthers.	2019	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, South China Agricultural University, 510642 Guangzhou, China.	Proteins of the ARGONAUTE (AGO) family function in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Although the rice (Oryza sativa) genome encodes 19 predicted AGO proteins, few of their functions have thus far been characterized. Here, we show that the AGO protein OsAGO2 regulates anther development in rice. OsAGO2 was highly expressed in anthers. Knockdown of OsAGO2 led to the overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and abnormal anther development, causing premature initiation of tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and pollen abortion. The expression level of Hexokinase 1 (OsHXK1) increased significantly, and the methylation levels of its promoter decreased, in plants with knocked-down OsAGO2 expression. Overexpression of OsHXK1 also resulted in the overaccumulation of ROS, premature initiation of PCD, and pollen abortion. Moreover, knockdown of OsHXK1 restored pollen fertility in OsAGO2 knockdown plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that OsAGO2 binds directly to the OsHXK1 promoter region, suggesting that OsHXK1 is a target gene of OsAGO2. These results indicate that OsHXK1 controls the appropriate production of ROS and the proper timing of tapetal PCD and is directly regulated by OsAGO2 through epigenetic regulation.
NA	ARGONAUTE2 Enhances Grain Length and Salt Tolerance by Activating BIG GRAIN3 to Modulate Cytokinin Distribution in Rice.	2020	Plant Cell	Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences CITY: Beijing China	Maintaining stable, high yields under fluctuating environmental conditions is a long-standing goal of crop improvement but is challenging due to internal trade-off mechanisms, which are poorly understood. Here, we identify ARGONAUTE2 (AGO2) as a candidate target for achieving this goal in rice (Oryza sativa). Overexpressing AGO2 led to a simultaneously increase in salt tolerance and grain  length. These benefits were achieved via the activation of BIG GRAIN3 (BG3), encoding a purine permease potentially involved in cytokinin transport. AGO2 can  become enriched on the BG3 locus and alter its histone methylation level, thus promoting BG3 expression. Cytokinin levels decreased in shoots but increased in roots of AGO2-overexpressing plants. While bg3 knockout mutants were hypersensitive to salt stress, plants overexpressing BG3 showed strong salt tolerance and large grains. The knockout of BG3 significantly reduced grain length and salt tolerance in AGO2-overexpressing plants. Both genes were transcriptionally suppressed by salt treatment. Salt treatment markedly increased cytokinin levels in roots but decreased them in shoots, resulting in a hormone distribution pattern similar to that in AGO2-overexpressing plants. These findings highlight the critical roles of the spatial distribution of cytokinins in both stress responses and grain development. Therefore, optimizing cytokinin distribution represents a promising strategy for improving both grain yield and stress tolerance in rice.
