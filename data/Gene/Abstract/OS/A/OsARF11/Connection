D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	OsARF11	DS1/OsEMF1 interacts with OsARF11 to control rice architecture by regulation of brassinosteroid signaling.	 DS1 interacts with OsARF11 to co-regulate OsBRI1 expression
OsARF11	OsARF12	Auxin response factors (ARFs) differentially regulate rice antiviral immune response against rice dwarf virus	 Strikingly, our genetic data showed that loss-of-function mutants of osarf12 or osarf16 exhibit reduced resistance whereas osarf11 mutants display enhanced resistance to RDV
