The tissue-specificity of ACO1 expression indicated that its transcript significantly accumulated in lower parts of elongating internodes at the heading stage. Histochemical analysis and in situ hybridization showed that the ACO1 expression was localized in the basal parts of leaf sheaths immediately above nodes or the lower parts of elongating internodes. To further examine the role of ACO1, ACO1-deficient (aco1) and overexpressing (ACO1-OX) mutants were characterized. The total length of the elongated internodes of aco1 mutants was slightly shorter than that of wild-type plants and that of ACO1-OX mutants was longer. Interestingly, expression of the ACC synthase gene ACS1 and ethylene signalling gene OsEIN2 was up-regulated in the aco1 mutants. This study suggests that the ACO1 has a little effect on internode elongation at the heading stage, and that up-regulation of the ACS1 and OsEIN2 expression may attenuate inhibition of internode elongation.
out-acs.pdf	Expression characteristics of OS-ACS1 and OS-ACS2, two members of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Habiganj Aman II) during partial submergence	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Plant Gene Expression Center, 800 Buchanan St., Albany, CA, 94710, USA	Deepwater rice can grow in the regions of Southeast Asia that are flooded during the monsoon season because it has several adaptations allowing it to survive under flooded conditions. One such adaptation is the ability for rapid internode elongation upon partial submergence to maintain its foliage above the rising flood water levels. Ethylene is considered to be the trigger of this growth response because deepwater conditions not only trap ethylene in submerged organs, but also enhance the activity of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase. Herein we have studied the expression characteristics of two members of the five-member multigene family encoding ACC synthase in rice OS-ACS1 and OS-ACS2 and show that partial submergence induces expression of OS-ACS1 and suppresses expression of OS-ACS2. The induction of OS-ACS1 occurs within 12 h of partial submergence and at low oxygen concentrations. The data also suggest that deepwater conditions posttranscriptionally regulate ACC synthase activity. OS-ACS1 gene expression may contribute to longer-term ethylene production, but not to the initial, growth-promoting increase in ethylene synthesis.
Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Jun-281-9.pdf	OsEIN2 is a positive component in ethylene signaling in rice	2004	Plant and Cell Physiology	National Research Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics, Division of Molecular and Life Sciences, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, 790-784 Korea.	EIN2 is a central signal transducer in the ethylene-signaling pathway, and a unique membrane-anchored protein. By screening a cDNA library, we have isolated a cDNA clone (OsEIN2) that encodes the rice EIN2 homolog. The full-length ORF clone was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. OsEIN2 shares significant amino acid sequence similarity with Arabidopsis EIN2 (57% similarity and 42% identity). Both the numbers and positions of introns and exons in the OsEIN2 and AtEIN2 coding regions are also conserved. To address whether this structural similarity is indicative of functional conservation of the corresponding proteins, we also generated transgenic lines expressing the antisense construct of OsEIN2. Those plants were stunted and shoot elongation was severely inhibited. Their phenotypes were similar to that found with wild-type rice seedlings that were treated with AgNO3, an ethylene signal inhibitor. In the OsEIN2 antisense plants, the expression levels of two ethylene-responsive genes, SC129 and SC255, were decreased compared with the wild types. These results suggest that OsEIN2 is a positive component of the ethylene-signaling pathway in rice, just as AtEIN2 is in Arabidopsis. Our antisense transgenic plants produced approximately 3.5 times more ethylene than the wild-type plants. Expression analysis of rice ACS and ACO genes showed that the transcript levels of OsACS1 and OsACS1 were elevated in the transgenic plants.
pp1421202.pdf	Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants	2006	Plant Physiol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The role of ethylene (ET) in resistance to infection with blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) in rice (Oryza sativa) is poorly understood. To study it, we quantified ET levels after inoculation, using young rice plants at the four-leaf stage of rice cv Nipponbare (wild type) and its isogenic plant (IL7), which contains the Pi-i resistance gene to blast fungus race 003. Small necrotic lesions by hypersensitive reaction (HR) were formed at 42 to 72 h postinoculation (hpi) in resistant IL7 leaves, and whitish expanding lesions at 96 hpi in susceptible wild-type leaves. Notable was the enhanced ET emission at 48 hpi accompanied by increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) levels and highly elevated ACC oxidase (ACO) activity in IL7 leaves, whereas only an enhanced ACC increase at 96 hpi in wild-type leaves. Among six ACC synthase (ACS) and seven ACO genes found in the rice genome, OsACS2 was transiently expressed at 48 hpi in IL7 and at 96 hpi in wild type, and OsACO7 was expressed at 48 hpi in IL7. Treatment with an inhibitor for ACS, aminooxyacetic acid, suppressed enhanced ET emission at 48 hpi in IL7, resulting in expanding lesions instead of HR lesions. Exogenously supplied ACC compromised the aminooxyacetic acid-induced breakdown of resistance in IL7, and treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene and silver thiosulfate, inhibitors of ET action, did not suppress resistance. These findings suggest the importance of ET biosynthesis and, consequently, the coproduct, cyanide, for HR-accompanied resistance to blast fungus in young rice plants and the contribution of induced OsACS2 and OsACO7 gene expression to it.
NA	Priming effect of root-applied silicon on the enhancement of induced resistance to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola in rice.	2018	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Biology of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 100193, Beijing, People's Republic of China.	Silicon (Si) can confer plant resistance to both abiotic and biotic stress. In the present study, the priming effect of Si on rice (Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare) against the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola and its histochemical and molecular impact on plant defense mechanisms were evaluated.Si amendment significantly reduced nematodes in rice roots and delayed their development, while no obvious negative effect on giant cells was observed. Increased resistance in rice was correlated with higher transcript levels of defense-related genes (OsERF1, OsEIN2 and OsACS1) in the ethylene (ET) pathway. Si amendment significantly reduced nematode numbers in rice plants with enhanced ET signaling but had no effect in plants deficient in ET signaling, indicating that the priming effects of Si were dependent on the ET pathway. A higher deposition of callose and accumulation of phenolic compounds were observed in rice roots after nematode attack in Si-amended plants than in the controls.These findings indicate that the priming effect may partially depend on the production of phenolic compounds and hydrogen peroxide. Further research is required to model the ethylene signal transduction pathway that occurs in the Si-plant-nematode interaction system and gain a better understanding of Si-induced defense in rice.
