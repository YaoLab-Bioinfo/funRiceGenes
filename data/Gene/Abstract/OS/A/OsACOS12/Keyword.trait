OsACOS12	pollen	OsACOS12, an orthologue of Arabidopsis acyl-CoA synthetase5, plays an important role in pollen exine formation and anther development in rice.	ACOS5 and OsACOS12 are conserved for pollen wall formation in monocot and dicot species
OsACOS12	anther	OsACOS12, an orthologue of Arabidopsis acyl-CoA synthetase5, plays an important role in pollen exine formation and anther development in rice.	The localization of OsACOS12-GFP demonstrated that OsACOS12 protein is accumulated in tapetal cells and anther locules
OsACOS12	sterile	OsACOS12, an orthologue of Arabidopsis acyl-CoA synthetase5, plays an important role in pollen exine formation and anther development in rice.	The osacos12 mutation caused by a pre-mature stop codon in LOC_Os04g24530 exhibits defective sexine resulting in a male sterile phenotype in rice
OsACOS12	fertility	OsACOS12, an orthologue of Arabidopsis acyl-CoA synthetase5, plays an important role in pollen exine formation and anther development in rice.	OsACOS12 driven by the ACOS5 promoter could partially restore the male fertility of the acos5 mutant in Arabidopsis
OsACOS12	tapetal	OsACOS12, an orthologue of Arabidopsis acyl-CoA synthetase5, plays an important role in pollen exine formation and anther development in rice.	In situ hybridization shows that OsACOS12 is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores at the transcript level
OsACOS12	tapetal	OsACOS12, an orthologue of Arabidopsis acyl-CoA synthetase5, plays an important role in pollen exine formation and anther development in rice.	The localization of OsACOS12-GFP demonstrated that OsACOS12 protein is accumulated in tapetal cells and anther locules
OsACOS12	pollen wall	OsACOS12, an orthologue of Arabidopsis acyl-CoA synthetase5, plays an important role in pollen exine formation and anther development in rice.	ACOS5 and OsACOS12 are conserved for pollen wall formation in monocot and dicot species
OsACOS12	pollen	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.

OsACOS12	sterility	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.	Loss of function mutation of rice OsACOS12 impairs lipid metabolism-mediated anther cuticle and pollen wall formation, and interferes with tapetum programmed cell death, leading to male sterility
OsACOS12	cell death	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.
OsACOS12	cell death	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.

OsACOS12	cuticle	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.	Loss of function mutation of rice OsACOS12 impairs lipid metabolism-mediated anther cuticle and pollen wall formation, and interferes with tapetum programmed cell death, leading to male sterility
OsACOS12	tapetum	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.
OsACOS12	tapetum	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.	Loss of function mutation of rice OsACOS12 impairs lipid metabolism-mediated anther cuticle and pollen wall formation, and interferes with tapetum programmed cell death, leading to male sterility
OsACOS12	tapetal	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.	 Those phenotypic changes were evident at stage 10, during which OsACOS12 had its maximum expression in tapetal cells and microspores
OsACOS12	pollen wall	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.	Loss of function mutation of rice OsACOS12 impairs lipid metabolism-mediated anther cuticle and pollen wall formation, and interferes with tapetum programmed cell death, leading to male sterility
OsACOS12	male sterility	Rice fatty acyl-CoA synthetase OsACOS12 is required for tapetum programmed cell death and male fertility.	Loss of function mutation of rice OsACOS12 impairs lipid metabolism-mediated anther cuticle and pollen wall formation, and interferes with tapetum programmed cell death, leading to male sterility
OsACOS12	fertility	Acyl-CoA synthetases from Physcomitrella, rice and Arabidopsis: different substrate preferences but common regulation by MS188 in sporopollenin synthesis.	 A complementation test showed that OsACOS12 driven by the ACOS5 promoter could partially restore the male fertility of the acos5 mutant in Arabidopsis, while PpACOS6 did not rescue the acos5 phenotype
