10.1007-s00425-013-1853-9.pdf	Phosphorylation of D-allose by hexokinase involved in regulation of OsABF1 expression for growth inhibition in Oryza sativa L	2013	Planta	Faculty of Agriculture, Rare Sugar Research Center, and Gene Research Center, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795, Japan.	We previously reported that a rare sugar D-allose, which is the D-glucose epimer at C3, inhibits the gibberellin-dependent responses such as elongation of the second leaf sheath and induction of alpha-amylase in embryo-less half seeds in rice (Fukumoto et al. 2011). D-Allose suppresses expressions of gibberellin-responsive genes downstream of SLR1 protein in the gibberellin-signaling through hexokinase (HXK)-dependent pathway. In this study, we discovered that D-allose induced expression of ABA-related genes including OsNCED1-3 and OsABA8ox1-3 in rice. Interestingly, D-allose also up-regulated expression of OsABF1, encoding a conserved bZIP transcription factor in ABA signaling, in rice. The D-allose-induced expression of OsABF1 was diminished by a hexokinase inhibitor, D-mannoheptulose (MNH). Consistently, D-allose also inhibited Arabidopsis growth, but failed to trigger growth retardation in the glucose-insensitive2 (gin2) mutant, which is a loss-of-function mutant of the glucose sensor AtHXK1. D-Allose activated AtABI5 expression in transgenic gin2 over-expressing wild-type AtHXK1 but not in gin2 over-expressing the catalytic mutant AtHXK1(S177A), indicating that the D-allose phosphorylation by HXK to D-allose 6-phosphate (A6P) is the first step for the up-regulation of AtABI5 gene expression as well as D-allose-induced growth inhibition. Moreover, overexpression of OsABF1 showed increased sensitivity to D-allose in rice. These findings indicated that the phosphorylation of D-allose at C6 by hexokinase is essential and OsABF1 is involved in the signal transduction for D-allose-induced growth inhibition.
Oliver-2007-ABA regulates apopla.pdf	ABA regulates apoplastic sugar transport and is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility in rice	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	CSIRO Plant Industry, Canberra, ACT, Australia.	Cold temperatures cause pollen sterility and large reductions in grain yield in temperate rice growing regions of the world. Induction of pollen sterility by cold involves a disruption of sugar transport in anthers, caused by the cold-induced repression of the apoplastic sugar transport pathway in the tapetum. Here we demonstrate that the phytohormone ABA is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility (CIPS). Cold treatment of the cold-sensitive cultivar Doongara resulted in increased anther ABA levels. Exogenous ABA treatment at the young microspore stage induced pollen sterility and affected cell wall invertase and monosaccharide transporter gene expression in a way similar to cold treatment. In the cold-tolerant cultivar R31, ABA levels were significantly lower under normal circumstances and remained low after cold treatment. The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated with differences in expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes encoding zeaxanthin epoxidase (OSZEP1) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (OSNCED2, OSNCED3) in anthers. The expression of three ABA-8-hydroxylase genes (ABA8OX1, 2 and 3) in R31 anthers was higher under control conditions and was regulated differently by cold compared with Doongara. Our results indicate that the cold tolerance phenotype of R31 is correlated with lower endogenous ABA levels and a different regulation of ABA metabolism.
Plant Cell Physiol-2007-Saika-287-98.pdf	Ethylene promotes submergence-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, a gene that encodes ABA 8'-hydroxylase in rice	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.	A rapid decrease of the plant hormone ABA under submergence is thought to be a prerequisite for the enhanced elongation of submerged shoots of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we report that the level of phaseic acid (PA), an oxidized form of ABA, increased with decreasing ABA level during submergence. The oxidation of ABA to PA is catalyzed by ABA 8'-hydroxylase, which is possibly encoded by three genes (OsABA8ox1, -2 and -3) in rice. The ABA 8'-hydroxylase activity was confirmed in microsomes from yeast expressing OsABA8ox1. OsABA8ox1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in onion cells was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. The mRNA level of OsABA8ox1, but not the mRNA levels of other OsABA8ox genes, increased dramatically within 1 h after submergence. On the other hand, the mRNA levels of genes involved in ABA biosynthesis (OsZEP and OsNCEDs) decreased after 1-2 h of submergence. Treatment of aerobic seedlings with ethylene and its precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), rapidly induced the expression of OsABA8ox1, but the ethylene treatment did not strongly affect the expression of ABA biosynthetic genes. Moreover, pre-treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), a potent inhibitor of ethylene action, partially suppressed induction of OsABA8ox1 expression under submergence. The ABA level was found to be negatively correlated with OsABA8ox1 expression under ACC or 1-MCP treatment. Together, these results indicate that the rapid decrease in ABA levels in submerged rice shoots is controlled partly by ethylene-induced expression of OsABA8ox1 and partly by ethylene-independent suppression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of ABA.
Plant Cell Physiol-2009-Zhu-644-51.pdf	Glucose-induced delay of seed germination in rice is mediated by the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than an enhancement of ABA biosynthesis	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	College of Life Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangdong, PR China.	Both glucose and ABA play crucial roles in the regulation of seed germination and post-germination development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, up-regulation of ABA biosynthesis is suggested as one of the possible mechanisms mediating the glucose-induced delay in seed germination. Since the endogenous ABA level is controlled by the equilibrium between ABA biosynthesis and catabolism, we investigated how this equilibrium is related to the regulation of seed germination by glucose in rice. When ABA biosynthesis was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of the ABA anabolic enzyme 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), rice seed germination showed no response. In contrast, inhibition of ABA catabolism by diniconazole significantly arrested seed germination, suggesting that the regulation of ABA catabolism plays a major role. Further experiments indicated that the expression of OsABA8ox3, a key gene in ABA catabolism and encoding ABA 8'-hydroxylase in rice, was significantly increased during the first 6 h of imbibition, which was consistent with the decline of ABA content in the imbibed seeds. Expression of OsABA8ox genes, especially OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3, was sensitively suppressed in the presence of exogenously supplied glucose. In contrast, the expression profiles of OsNCED genes that control the limiting step of ABA biosynthesis showed no significant changes in response to low levels of glucose. Our results demonstrated that the glucose-induced delay of seed germination is a result of the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than any enhancement of ABA biosynthesis during rice seed germination.
NA	Copper suppresses abscisic acid catabolism and catalase activity, and inhibits seed germination of rice.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China.	Although copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for plants, a slight excess of Cu in soil can be harmful to plants. Unfortunately, Cu contamination is a growing problem all over the world due to human activities, and poses a soil stress to plant development. As one of the most important biological processes, seed germination is sensitive to Cu stress. However, little is known about the mechanism of Cu-induced inhibition of seed germination. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between Cu and ABA which is the predominant regulator of seed germination. Cu at a concentration of 30 M effectively inhibited germination of rice caryopsis. ABA content in germinating seeds under copper stress was also higher than that under control conditions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that Cu treatment reduced the expression of OsABA8ox2, a key gene of ABA catabolism in rice seeds. In addition, both malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 contents were increased by Cu stress in the germinating seeds. Antioxidant enzyme assays revealed that only catalase activity was reduced by excess Cu, which was consistent with the mRNA profile of OsCATa during seed germination under Cu stress. Together, our results demonstrate that suppression of ABA catabolism and catalase (CAT) activity by excess Cu leads to the inhibition of seed germination of rice.
NA	Improving pre-harvest sprouting resistance in rice by editing OsABA8ox using CRISPR/Cas9.	2022	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Provincial Research Center of Plant Gene Editing Engineering, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Knock out OsABA8ox helps improve pre-harvest spouting resistance and do not affect rice yield. Pre-harvest sprouting(PHS) is a phenomenon that the seeds of crops germinate preharvest, which reduces the yield and quality of rice. Abscisic acid(ABA) is one of the phytohormones that promotes seed dormancy. ABA8&#x27; hydroxylase is the main enzyme that can catabolism ABA in plant. There are three genes that encode ABA8&#x27; hydroxylase in rice, named OsABA8ox1, OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3. In this study, we use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to target these three genes in Ningjing6 and find that the knockout transgenic lines are all significantly strengthen in seed dormancy and have no effect on the yield. By a series of quantitative experiments, we consider that after knock out OsABA8ox, the high endogenous ABA level will influence the ABA signal which suppress the substantial and energy metabolism in the seeds, and finally led to higher dormancy.
