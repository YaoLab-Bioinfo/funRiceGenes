The TIFY family is a novel plant-specific gene family involved in the regulation of diverse plant-specific biologic processes, such as development and responses to phytohormones, in Arabidopsis. However, there is limited information about this family in monocot species. This report identifies 20 TIFY genes in rice, the model monocot species. Sequence analysis indicated that rice TIFY proteins have conserved motifs beyond the TIFY domain as was previously shown in Arabidopsis. On the basis of their protein structures, members of the TIFY family can be divided into two groups. Transcript level analysis of OsTIFY genes in tissues and organs revealed different tempo-spatial expression patterns, suggesting that expression and function vary by stage of plant growth and development. Most of the OsTIFY genes were predominantly expressed in leaf. Nine OsTIFY genes were responsive to jasmonic acid and wounding treatments. Interestingly, almost all the OsTIFY genes were responsive to one or more abiotic stresses including drought, salinity, and low temperature. Over-expression of OsTIFY11a, one of the stress-inducible genes, resulted in significantly increased tolerance to salt and dehydration stresses. These results suggest that the OsTIFY family may have important roles in response to abiotic stresses. The data presented in this report provide important clues for further elucidating the functions of the genes in the OsTIFY family.
Plant Cell Physiol-2012-Yamada-2060-72.pdf	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795 Japan.	The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) has a crucial role in both host immunity and development in plants. Here, we report the importance of JA signaling in the defense system of rice. Exogenous application of JA conferred resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in rice. Expression of OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain protein, was highly up-regulated by JA. OsJAZ8 interacted with a putative OsCOI1, which is a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner. OsJAZ8 also formed heterodimers with other OsJAZ proteins but did not form homodimer. JA treatment caused OsJAZ8 degradation and this degradation was dependent on the 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the JA-dependent OsJAZ8 degradation was mediated by the Jas domain. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsJAZ8DeltaC, which lacks the Jas domain, exhibited a JA-insensitive phenotype. A large-scale analysis using a rice DNA microarray revealed that overexpression of OsJAZ8DeltaC altered the expression of JA-responsive genes, including defense-related genes, in rice. Furthermore, OsJAZ8DeltaC negatively regulated the JA-induced resistance to Xoo in rice. On the basis of these data, we conclude that JA plays an important role in resistance to Xoo, and OsJAZ8 acts as a repressor of JA signaling in rice.
NA	Salt-inducible expression of OsJAZ8 improves resilience against salt-stress.	2018	BMC Plant Biol	Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Botanical Institute, Karlsruhe, Germany.	Productivity of important crop rice is greatly affected by salinity. The plant hormone jasmonate plays a vital role in salt stress adaptation, but also evokes detrimental side effects if not timely shut down again. As novel strategy to avoid such side effects, OsJAZ8, a negative regulator of jasmonate signalling, is expressed under control of the salt-inducible promoter of the transcription factor ZOS3-11, to obtain a transient jasmonate signature in response to salt stress. To modulate the time course of jasmonate signalling, either a full-length or a dominant negative C-terminally truncated version of OsJAZ8 driven by the ZOS3-11 promoter were expressed in a stable manner either in tobacco BY-2 cells, or in japonica rice.The transgenic tobacco cells showed reduced mortality and efficient cycling under salt stress adaptation. This was accompanied by reduced sensitivity to Methyl jasmonate and increased responsiveness to auxin. In the case of transgenic rice, the steady-state levels of OsJAZ8 transcripts were more efficiently induced under salt stress compared to the wild type, this induction was more pronounced in the dominant-negative OsJAZ8 variant.The result concluded that, more efficient activation of OsJAZ8 was accompanied by improved salt tolerance of the transgenic seedlings and demonstrates the impact of temporal signatures of jasmonate signalling for stress tolerance.
