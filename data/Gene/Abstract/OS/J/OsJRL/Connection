OsDREB1A|OsDREBL|OsCBF3	OsJRL	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	Overexpression of OsJRL in rice also enhanced salinity tolerance and increased the expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including three LEA (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) genes (OsLEA19a, OsLEA23 and OsLEA24), three Na(+) transporter genes (OsHKT1;3, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5) and two DREB genes (OsDREB1A and OsDREB2B)
OsDREB2B	OsJRL	OsJRL, a rice jacalin-related mannose-binding lectin gene, enhances Escherichia coli viability under high-salinity stress and improves salinity tolerance of rice.	Overexpression of OsJRL in rice also enhanced salinity tolerance and increased the expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including three LEA (late embryogenesis abundant proteins) genes (OsLEA19a, OsLEA23 and OsLEA24), three Na(+) transporter genes (OsHKT1;3, OsHKT1;4 and OsHKT1;5) and two DREB genes (OsDREB1A and OsDREB2B)
