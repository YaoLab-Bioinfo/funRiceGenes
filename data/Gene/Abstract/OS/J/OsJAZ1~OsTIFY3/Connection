OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	OsJAZ1|OsTIFY3|EG2	OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice	OsJAZ1, a rice ZIM domain protein, interacted with OsbHLH148 in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, but it interacted with the putative OsCOI1 only in the presence of coronatine
OsCOI1|OsCOI1a	OsJAZ1|OsTIFY3|EG2	OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice	Furthermore, the OsJAZ1 protein was degraded by rice and Arabidopsis extracts in the presence of coronatine, and its degradation was inhibited by MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, suggesting 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of OsJAZ1 via the SCF(OsCOI1) complex
OsbHLH148	OsJAZ1|OsTIFY3|EG2	OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice	OsJAZ1, a rice ZIM domain protein, interacted with OsbHLH148 in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, but it interacted with the putative OsCOI1 only in the presence of coronatine
OsbHLH148	OsJAZ1|OsTIFY3|EG2	OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice	These results show that OsJAZ1 could act as a transcriptional regulator of the OsbHLH148-related jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance
OsJAZ1|OsTIFY3|EG2	OsMYC2	Jasmonic acid regulates spikelet development in rice	OsJAZ1 also interacts with OsMYC2, a transcription factor in the JA signalling pathway, and represses OsMYC2's role in activating OsMADS1, an E-class gene crucial to the spikelet development.
OsJAZ1|OsTIFY3|EG2	OsJAZ6	Ectopic Expression of OsJAZ6, which Interacts with OsJAZ1, Alters JA Signaling and Spikelet Development in Rice.	Ectopic Expression of OsJAZ6, which Interacts with OsJAZ1, Alters JA Signaling and Spikelet Development in Rice.
OsJAZ1|OsTIFY3|EG2	OsJAZ6	Ectopic Expression of OsJAZ6, which Interacts with OsJAZ1, Alters JA Signaling and Spikelet Development in Rice.	 Here, we found that OsJAZ6 interacts with OsJAZ1 depending on a single amino acid in the so-called ZIM domain of OsJAZ6 in rice JA signaling transduction and JA-regulated rice spikelet development
