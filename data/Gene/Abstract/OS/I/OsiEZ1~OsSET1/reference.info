1-s2.0-S0378111903007236-main.pdf	A POLYCOMB group gene of rice (Oryza sativa L. subspecies indica), OsiEZ1, codes for a nuclear-localized protein expressed preferentially in young seedlings and during reproductive development	2003	Gene	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, 110021, New Delhi, India.	The SET domains are conserved amino acid sequences present in chromosomal proteins that contribute to the epigenetic control of gene expression by altering regional organization of the chromatin structure. The SET domain proteins are divided into four subgroups as categorized by their Drosophila members; enhancer of zeste (E(Z)), trithorax (TRX), absent small or homeotic 1 (ASH1) and supressor of variegation (SU(VAR)3-9). Homologs of all four classes have been characterized in yeast, mammals and plants. We report here the isolation and characterization of rice (Oryza sativa L. subspecies indica) cDNA, OsiEZ1, as a monocot member of this family. The OsiEZ1 cDNA is 3133 bp long with an ORF of 2799 bp, and the predicted amino acid sequence (895 residues) corresponds to a protein of ca. 98 kDa. All the characteristic domains known to be conserved in E(Z) homologs (subgroup I) of SET domain containing proteins are present in OsiEZ1. In the rice genome, a 7499 bp long OsiEZ1 sequence is split into 17 exons interrupted by 16 introns. Southern analysis indicates that OsiEZ1 is represented as single copy in the rice genome. Expression studies revealed that the OsiEZ1 transcript level was highest in rice flowers, almost undetectable in developing seeds of 1-2 days post-fertilization but increased significantly in young seeds of 3-5 days post-fertilization. The OsiEZ1 transcript was barely detectable in mature zygotic embryos, but its levels were significantly higher in callus derived from rice scutellum, somatic embryos and young seedlings. The OsiEZ1/GUS recombinant protein was confined to the nucleus in living cells of particle-bombarded onion peels. The expression of OsiEZ1 complemented a set1Delta Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant that is impaired in telomeric silencing. We suggest that the nuclear-localized OsiEZ1 has a role in regulating various aspects of plant development, and this control is most likely brought about by repressing the activity of downstream regulatory genes.
10.1007-s11816-012-0229-0.pdf	Involvement of rice Polycomb protein OsFIE2 in plant growth and seed size	2012	Plant Biotechnology Reports	Bio-crop Development Division, Department of Agricultural Bio-resources, National Academy of Agricultural Science, RDA, Suwon, 441-701, Republic of Korea	Seed development is a complex but orchestrated process that requires the fine-tuning of parentally governed gene expression, which is regulated by Polycomb proteins. Over the last decade, various Polycomb proteins have been identified and functionally characterized in plants, and it has been found that they form the PRC2 suppressor complex, which is involved in various developmental programs, including seed development. In this study, the function of the rice fertilization-independent endosperm gene OsFIE2, which expresses a protein homologous to the Arabidopsis Polycomb protein FIE, was characterized. We also characterized OsEZ1/OsiEZ1, another key component of the PRC2 complex. Both the OsFIE2 and OsEZ11 genes are strongly expressed in leaf and stem compared to other tissues, including root, anther, ovary, and ovule. We further examined whether OsFIE2 interacted with OsEZ1 using a yeast two-hybrid system. Interaction analysis showed that OsFIE2 interacted with OsEZ1 but not with Arabidopsis MEA protein. To examine the physiological roles of OsFIE2, 35S:OsFIE2 Arabidopsis lines were generated. Transgenic plants with 35S:OsFIE2 grew faster than wild-type plants during early development. Importantly, they produced bigger seed than the wild type, indicating that OsFIE2 may play an important role in seed size. In addition, we generated pOsFIE2:GUS plants to examine the spatial expression pattern of OsFIE2. GUS expression was detected in cotyledon but not in any other tissues, suggesting that OsFIE2 expression may be required to suppress homeotic genes in cotyledon.
44545945.pdf	Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes	2009	Mol Plant	CSIRO Plant Industry, GPO BOX 1600, ACT 2601, Australia. ming.luo@csiro.au	Polycomb group proteins (PcG) play important roles in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Some core PcG proteins, such as Enhancer of Zeste (E(z)), Suppressor of Zeste (12) (Su(z)12), and Extra Sex Combs (ESC), are conserved in plants. The rice genome contains two E(z)-like genes, OsiEZ1 and OsCLF, two homologs of Su(z)12, OsEMF2a and OsEMF2b, and two ESC-like genes, OsFIE1 and OsFIE2. OsFIE1 is expressed only in endosperm; the maternal copy is expressed while the paternal copy is not active. Other rice PcG genes are expressed in a wide range of tissues and are not imprinted in the endosperm. The two E(z)-like genes appear to have duplicated before the separation of the dicots and monocots; the two homologs of Su(z)12 possibly duplicated during the evolution of the Gramineae and the two ESC-like genes are likely to have duplicated in the ancestor of the grasses. No homologs of the Arabidopsis seed-expressed PcG genes MEA and FIS2 were identified in the rice genome. We have isolated T-DNA insertion lines in the rice homologs of three PcG genes. There is no autonomous endosperm development in these T-DNA insertion lines. One line with a T-DNA insertion in OsEMF2b displays pleiotropic phenotypes including altered flowering time and abnormal flower organs, suggesting important roles in rice development for this gene.
J. Exp. Bot.-2003-Liang-1995-6.pdf	OsSET1, a novel SET-domain-containing gene from rice	2003	J Exp Bot	PKU-Yale Joint Research Center of Agricultural and Plant Molecular Biology, National Key Laboratory of Protein Engineering and Plant Gene Engineering, College of Life Sciences, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road, Beijing 100871, PR China.	A novel SET-domain-containing gene OsSET1 was isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.). Its deduced protein consists of 895 amino acids. OsSET1 has a high degree of structure similarity to other SET-domain-containing genes such as CLF in higher plants and E(z) in animals. RT-PCR showed that the gene expresses throughout the entire plant. A transient expression assay in onion epidermis revealed that the OsSET1 protein is localized in nuclei. Over-expression of the SET domain of OsSET1 in Arabidopsis resulted in altered shoot development at seedling stages.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
