Starch-debranching enzymes (DBEs) are key enzymes involved in starch metabolism in cereals, having a dual function, in both starch synthesis and degradation. However, their precise roles in this pathway, particularly their expression profiles, remain unclear. In the present study, we performed a quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis of the expression pattern of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type DBE in different tissues as well as in seeds at different developmental stages. The results showed that this gene was expressed only in seeds. In addition, the 1177-bp OsPUL promoter sequence was cloned, and some endosperm-specific motifs such as the GCN4 and AACA motifs were observed to exist in this region. The promoter was then fused with the GUS reporter gene and its expression was carefully investigated in transgenic rice. The data from both histochemical and fluorometric analyses showed that the OsPUL promoter was capable of driving the target gene to have a high level of endosperm-specific expression. The OsPUL gene maintained a relatively high expression level during the entire period of seed development, and peaked in the middle and late stages. This observation was very consistent with that of the endogenous transcription analysis by Q-PCR. Furthermore, the seed germination experiment showed that the OsPUL promoter actively functions in the late stage of seed germination. The expression of the OsPUL gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism.

The present study established that there are two distinct polymeric forms of isoamylase1 (ISA1) in rice endosperm: presumably a homo-pentamer of ISA1 and a hetero-hexamer composed of five ISA1 and one ISA2. The molecular sizes of the homo- and hetero-oligomers, which could be fractionated by hydrophobic chromatography, were approximately 420-480 and 510-550 kDa, respectively. The hetero-oligomer exhibited higher affinities for various branched polyglucans, especially for phytoglycogen, which had a K(m) value that was approximately 12 times lower relative to that with the homo-oligomer, although no marked differences were found in chain preferences for debranching of amylopectin and phytoglycogen between these forms. The hetero-oligomer was active even when incubated at 50 degrees C for 10 min, while the homo-multimer was completely inactivated at 40 degrees C in 10 min. When the ISA1 homo-oligomer was incubated with the ISA2 protein expressed in Escherichia coli and applied onto a nondenature polyacrylamide gel, additional debranching activity bands which were specific for the purified ISA1-ISA2 preparation were also detected, indicating that ISA1 and ISA2 combine to form a hetero-oligomer. These results suggest that the hetero-oligomer plays a predominant role in the amylopectin biosynthesis in rice endosperm although the homo-oligomer can complement the function of the hetero-oligomer at least to some extent.
pcr058.pdf	Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai, Tsukuba, Japan.	Debranching enzymes, which hydrolyze alpha-1 and 6-glucosidic linkages in alpha-polyglucans, play a dual role in the synthesis and degradation of starch in plants. A transposon-inserted rice mutant of isoamylase3 (isa3) contained an increased amount of starch in the leaf blade at the end of the night, indicating that ISA3 plays a role in the degradation of transitory starch during the night. An epitope-tagged ISA3 expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited hydrolytic activity on beta-limit dextrin and amylopectin. We investigated whether ISA3 plays a role in amyloplast development and starch metabolism in the developing endosperm. ISA3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein expressed under the control of the rice ISA3 promoter was targeted to the amyloplast stroma in the endosperm. Overexpression of ISA3 in the sugary1 mutant, which is deficient in ISA1 activity, did not convert water-soluble phytoglycogen to starch granules, indicating that ISA1 and ISA3 are not functionally redundant. Both overexpression and loss of function of ISA3 in the endosperm generated pleomorphic amyloplasts and starch granules. Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic. These results suggest that ISA3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects morphological characteristics of plastids in rice.
NA	Sugary Endosperm is Modulated by Starch Branching Enzyme IIa in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2017	Rice (N Y)	Department of Plant Science and Research Institute for Agriculture and Life Sciences, and Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, South Korea.	Starch biosynthesis is one of the most important pathways that determine both grain quality and yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Sugary endosperm, sugary-1 (sug-1), is a mutant trait for starch biosynthesis. Rice plants carrying sug-1 produce grains that accumulate water-soluble carbohydrates instead of starch, even after maturity. Although this trait enhances the diversity of grain quality, sugary endosperm rice has hardly been commercialized due to the severely wrinkled grains and subsequent problems in milling. This study was conducted to identify the genes responsible for the sug-h phenotype through a map-based cloning technology.We induced a mild sugary mutant, sugary-h (sug-h) through the chemical mutagenesis on the Korean japonica cultivar Hwacheong. Grains of the sug-h mutant were translucent and amber-colored, and the endosperm appeared less wrinkled than sug-1, whereas the soluble sugar content was fairly high. These characteristics confer greater marketability to the sug-h mutant. Genetic analyses indicated that the sug-h mutant phenotype was controlled by a complementary interaction of two recessive genes, Isoamylase1 (OsISA1), which was reported previously, and Starch branching enzyme IIa (OsBEIIa), which was newly identified in this study. Complementation tests indicated that OsBEIIa regulated the properties of sugary endosperm.Complementary interactions between the starch biosynthesis genes OsISA1 and OsBEIIa determine the mild sugary endosperm mutant, sugary-h, in rice. Our finding may facilitate the breeding of sugaryendosperm rice for commercial benefit.
NA	Endosperm sugar accumulation caused by mutation of PHS8/ISA1 leads to pre-harvest sprouting in rice.	2018	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) is an unfavorable trait in cereal crops which could seriously decrease grain yield and quality. Although some PHS-associated quantitative trait loci (QTL) or genes in cereals have been reported, the molecular mechanism underlying PHS remains largely elusive. Here, we characterized a rice mutant, phs8, which exhibits PHS phenotype accompanied by sugary endosperm. Map-based cloning revealed that PHS8 encodes a starch debranching enzyme named isoamylase1. Mutation in PHS8 resulted in the phytoglycogen breakdown and sugar accumulation in the endosperm. Intriguingly, with increase of sugar contents, decreased expression of OsABI3 and OsABI5 as well as reduced sensitivity to ABA were found in the phs8 mutant. Using rice suspension cell system, we confirmed that exogenous sugar is sufficient to suppress the expression of both OsABI3 and OsABI5. Furthermore, overexpression of OsABI3 or OsABI5 could partially rescue the PHS phenotype of phs8. Therefore, our study presents important evidence supporting that endosperm sugar not only acts as an essential energy source for seed germination but also determines seed dormancy and germination by affecting ABA signaling.
