OsbHLH001|OsICE2	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation	These sizes are consistent with those predicted for OsICE1 and OsICE2, respectively
OsbHLH001|OsICE2	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	Rice homologs of inducer of CBF expression (OsICE) are involved in cold acclimation	In contrast to the proteins, cold stress had little or no effect on the expression of OsICE1 and OsICE2
OsbHLH001|OsICE2	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	The Rice Transcription Factors OsICE Confer Enhanced Cold Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis.	 Here we identified that OsICE1 and OsICE2 in rice shared highly conserved amino acid sequence with AtICE1 in Arabidopsis
OsbHLH001|OsICE2	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	The Rice Transcription Factors OsICE Confer Enhanced Cold Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis.	 Overexpression of OsICE1 and OsICE2 in Arabidopsis significantly enhanced the cold tolerance of Arabidopsis seedlings and improved the expression of cold-response genes
OsbHLH001|OsICE2	OsICE1|OsbHLH002	The Rice Transcription Factors OsICE Confer Enhanced Cold Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis.	 Furthermore, we showed that both OsICE1 and OsICE2 physically interact with OsMYBS3, a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor that is essential for cold adaptation in rice, suggesting that OsICE1/OsICE2 and OsMYBS3 probably act through specific signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate cold tolerance in rice
MYBS3|OsMYBS3	OsbHLH001|OsICE2	The Rice Transcription Factors OsICE Confer Enhanced Cold Tolerance in Transgenic Arabidopsis.	 Furthermore, we showed that both OsICE1 and OsICE2 physically interact with OsMYBS3, a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor that is essential for cold adaptation in rice, suggesting that OsICE1/OsICE2 and OsMYBS3 probably act through specific signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate cold tolerance in rice
