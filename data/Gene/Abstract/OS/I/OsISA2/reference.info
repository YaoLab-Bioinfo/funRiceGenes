The present study established that there are two distinct polymeric forms of isoamylase1 (ISA1) in rice endosperm: presumably a homo-pentamer of ISA1 and a hetero-hexamer composed of five ISA1 and one ISA2. The molecular sizes of the homo- and hetero-oligomers, which could be fractionated by hydrophobic chromatography, were approximately 420-480 and 510-550 kDa, respectively. The hetero-oligomer exhibited higher affinities for various branched polyglucans, especially for phytoglycogen, which had a K(m) value that was approximately 12 times lower relative to that with the homo-oligomer, although no marked differences were found in chain preferences for debranching of amylopectin and phytoglycogen between these forms. The hetero-oligomer was active even when incubated at 50 degrees C for 10 min, while the homo-multimer was completely inactivated at 40 degrees C in 10 min. When the ISA1 homo-oligomer was incubated with the ISA2 protein expressed in Escherichia coli and applied onto a nondenature polyacrylamide gel, additional debranching activity bands which were specific for the purified ISA1-ISA2 preparation were also detected, indicating that ISA1 and ISA2 combine to form a hetero-oligomer. These results suggest that the hetero-oligomer plays a predominant role in the amylopectin biosynthesis in rice endosperm although the homo-oligomer can complement the function of the hetero-oligomer at least to some extent.
ert187.pdf	OsbZIP58, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, regulates starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm	2013	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, PR China.	Starch composition and the amount in endosperm, both of which contribute dramatically to seed yield, cooking quality, and taste in cereals, are determined by a series of complex biochemical reactions. However, the mechanism regulating starch biosynthesis in cereal seeds is not well understood. This study showed that OsbZIP58, a bZIP transcription factor, is a key transcriptional regulator controlling starch synthesis in rice endosperm. OsbZIP58 was expressed mainly in endosperm during active starch synthesis. osbzip58 null mutants displayed abnormal seed morphology with altered starch accumulation in the white belly region and decreased amounts of total starch and amylose. Moreover, osbzip58 had a higher proportion of short chains and a lower proportion of intermediate chains of amylopectin. Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, OsSSIIa, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression. These findings indicate that OsbZIP58 functions as a key regulator of starch synthesis in rice seeds and provide new insights into seed quality control.
NA	The buffering capacity of stems: genetic architecture of nonstructural carbohydrates in cultivated Asian rice, Oryza sativa.	2017	New Phytol	Section<U+00A0>of Plant Breeding and Genetics, School of Integrated Plant Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853-1901, USA.	Harnessing stem carbohydrate dynamics in grasses offers an opportunity to help meet future demands for plant-based food, fiber and fuel production, but requires a greater understanding of the genetic controls that govern the synthesis, interconversion and transport of such energy reserves. We map out a blueprint of the genetic architecture of rice (Oryza sativa) stem nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) at two critical developmental time-points using a subpopulation-specific genome-wide association approach on two diverse germplasm panels followed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in a biparental population. Overall, 26 QTL are identified; three are detected in multiple panels and are associated with starch-at-maturity, sucrose-at-maturity and NSC-at-heading. They tag OsHXK6 (rice hexokinase), ISA2 (rice isoamylase) and a tandem array of sugar transporters. This study provides the foundation for more in-depth molecular investigation to validate candidate genes underlying rice stem NSC and informs future comparative studies in other agronomically vital grass species.
NA	Phenotypic, Transcriptomic, and Metabolomic Signatures of Root-Specifically Overexpressed OsCKX2 in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	Henan Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Grain Crops, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, China.	Cytokinins are crucial signaling molecules that regulate plant growth and development. OsCKX2 irreversibly degrades nucleobase cytokinins by encoding cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase to control grain production in rice. In this study, OsCKX2 was specifically overexpressed in roots using RCc3 promoter to investigate the effects of root-source cytokinins on the growth of rice. OsCKX2 overexpressed (OE) rice showed retarded growth with lower cytokinin levels and biomass production. Shoot-specific transcriptome analysis between OsCKX2 OE rice and wild type (WT) revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with cell division, cell wall structure, phytohormone signaling, and assimilation and catabolism. Metabolome analysis indicated that a majority of differential primary metabolites, such as amino acids and organic acids, increased, while lipids decreased in OsCKX2 OE rice. Integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic data showed that several DEGs and differential metabolites were related to glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). To conclude, reduced cytokinin levels via root-specific overexpression of OsCKX2 resulted in developmental defects, which confirmed the importance of root-source cytokinins in plant growth and morphogenesis.
