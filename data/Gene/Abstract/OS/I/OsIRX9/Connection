OsIRX14	OsIRX9	Three Novel Rice Genes Closely Related to the Arabidopsis IRX9, IRX9L, and IRX14 Genes and Their Roles in Xylan Biosynthesis	We identified three rice genes Os07g49370 (OsIRX9), Os01g48440 (OsIRX9L), and Os06g47340 (OsIRX14), from glycosyltransferase family 43 as putative orthologs to the putative beta-1,4-xylan backbone elongating Arabidopsis IRX9, IRX9L, and IRX14 genes, respectively
OsIRX14	OsIRX9	Three Novel Rice Genes Closely Related to the Arabidopsis IRX9, IRX9L, and IRX14 Genes and Their Roles in Xylan Biosynthesis	Taken together, our results suggest that OsIRX9/OsIRX9L, and OsIRX14, have similar functions to the Arabidopsis IRX9 and IRX14 genes, respectively
OsIRX14	OsIRX9	Three Novel Rice Genes Closely Related to the Arabidopsis IRX9, IRX9L, and IRX14 Genes and Their Roles in Xylan Biosynthesis	We demonstrate that the over-expression of the closely related rice genes, in full or partly complement the two well-characterized Arabidopsis irregular xylem (irx) mutants: irx9 and irx14
