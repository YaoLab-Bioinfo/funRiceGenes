IDEF1	OsIMA2	Iron deficiency-inducible peptide coding genes OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 positively regulate a major pathway of iron uptake and translocation in rice	 Here, we report that the expressions of two IMA/FEP genes in rice, OsIMA1 and OsIMA2, are strongly induced under Fe-deficiency, positively regulated by the transcription factors IDEF1, OsbHLH058, OsbHLH059, as well as OsIMA1 and OsIMA2 themselves, and negatively regulated by HRZ ubiquitin ligases
