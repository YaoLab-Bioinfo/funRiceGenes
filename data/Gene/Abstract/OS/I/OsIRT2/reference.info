Only graminaceous monocots possess the Strategy II iron (Fe)-uptake system in which Fe is absorbed by roots as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore. In spite of being a Strategy II plant, however, rice (Oryza sativa) contains the previously identified Fe2+ transporter OsIRT1. In this study, we isolated the OsIRT2 gene from rice, which is highly homologous to OsIRT1. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 are expressed predominantly in roots, and these transporters are induced by low-Fe conditions. When expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells, OsIRT2 cDNA reversed the growth defects of a yeast Fe-uptake mutant. This was similar to the effect of OsIRT1 cDNA. OsIRT1- and OsIRT2-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins localized to the plasma membrane when transiently expressed in onion (Allium cepa L.) epidermal cells. OsIRT1 promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsIRT1 is expressed in the epidermis and exodermis of the elongating zone and in the inner layer of the cortex of the mature zone of Fe-deficient roots. OsIRT1 expression was also detected in the ccompanion cells. Analysis using the positron-emitting tracer imaging system showed that rice plants are able to take up both an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and Fe2+. This result indicates that, in addition to absorbing an Fe3+-phytosiderophore, rice possesses a novel Fe-uptake system that directly absorbs the Fe2+, a strategy that is advantageous for growth in submerged conditions.
j.1747-0765.2006.00055.x.pdf	Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice	2006	Soil Science and Plant Nutrition	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657	Cadmium (Cd) accumulation in rice grains is enhanced if ponded water is released from paddy fields during the reproductive stage (intermittent irrigation). The release of ponded water creates aerobic soil conditions under which Cd becomes soluble and iron (Fe) solubility decreases. We hypothesized that Fe shortage in rice induces Fe uptake and translocation and that Cd is also taken up and translocated throughout this process. Hydroponically cultured Fe-deficient rice absorbed more Cd than did Fe-sufficient rice, and the presence of Fe enhanced the translocation of Cd to the shoots. Yeast mutants expressing OsIRT1 and OsIRT2, which encode the rice Fe2+ transporter, became more sensitive to Cd, suggesting that Cd was absorbed by OsIRT1 and OsIRT2. We discuss the possibility that Cd accumulation in rice grains during the reproductive stage is mediated by the Fe transport system.
NA	Comparative transcriptome profile analysis of rice varieties with different tolerance to zinc deficiency	2020	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	CAAS-IRRI Joint Laboratory for Genomics-Assisted Germplasm Enhancement, Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Zinc (Zn) is an indispensable element for rice growth. Zn deficiency results in brown blotches and streaks 2-3 weeks after transplanting, as well as stunting, reduced tillering, and low productivity of rice plants. These processes are controlled by different families of expressed genes. A comparative transcriptome profile analysis was conducted using the roots of two Zn deficiency tolerant varieties (UCP122 and KALIBORO26) and two sensitive varieties (IR26 and IR64) by merging data from untreated control (CK) and Zn deficiency treated samples. Results revealed a total of 4,688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal Zn and deficient conditions, with 2,702 and 1,489 unique DEGs upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified transcription factors (TFs), such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, and bHLH which are important in the regulation of the Zn deficiency response. Furthermore, chitinases, jasmonic acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways were found to be important in the Zn deficiency response. The metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes also appeared to play an important role in conferring tolerance to Zn deficiency. A heavy metal-associated domain-containing protein 7 was associated with tolerance to Zn deficiency and negatively regulated downstream genes. Collectively, our findings provide valuable expression patterns and candidate genes for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to Zn deficiency and for improvements in breeding for tolerance to Zn deficiency in rice.
