2011-26.pdf	Ethylene is involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron-acquisition-related genes in Oryza sativa	2011	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.	Plants employ two distinct strategies to obtain iron (Fe) from the soil. In Strategy I but not Strategy II plants, Fe limitation invokes ethylene production which regulates Fe deficiency responses. Oryza sativa (rice) is the only graminaceous plant described that possesses a Strategy I-like system for iron uptake as well as the classic Strategy II system. Ethylene production of rice roots was significantly increased when grown under Fe-depleted conditions. Moreover, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) treatment, a precursor of ethylene, conferred tolerance to Fe deficiency in rice by increasing internal Fe availability. Gene expression analysis of rice iron-regulated bHLH transcription factor OsIRO2, nicotianamine synthases 1 and 2 (NAS1 and NAS2), yellow-stripe like transporter 15 (YSL15) and iron-regulated transporter (IRT1) indicated that ethylene caused an increase in transcript abundance of both Fe (II) and Fe (III)-phytosiderophore uptake systems. RNA interference of OsIRO2 in transgenic rice showed that ethylene acted via this transcription factor to induce the expression of OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL15, and OsIRT1. By contrast, in Hordeum vulgare L. (barley), no ethylene production or ethylene-mediated effects of Fe response could be detected. In conclusion, Fe-limiting conditions increased ethylene production and signalling in rice, which is novel in Strategy II plant species.
21025376.pdf	Rice plants take up iron as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and as Fe2+	2006	Plant J	Department of Global Agricultural Sciences, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Only graminaceous monocots possess the Strategy II iron (Fe)-uptake system in which Fe is absorbed by roots as an Fe3+-phytosiderophore. In spite of being a Strategy II plant, however, rice (Oryza sativa) contains the previously identified Fe2+ transporter OsIRT1. In this study, we isolated the OsIRT2 gene from rice, which is highly homologous to OsIRT1. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 are expressed predominantly in roots, and these transporters are induced by low-Fe conditions. When expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells, OsIRT2 cDNA reversed the growth defects of a yeast Fe-uptake mutant. This was similar to the effect of OsIRT1 cDNA. OsIRT1- and OsIRT2-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins localized to the plasma membrane when transiently expressed in onion (Allium cepa L.) epidermal cells. OsIRT1 promoter-GUS analysis revealed that OsIRT1 is expressed in the epidermis and exodermis of the elongating zone and in the inner layer of the cortex of the mature zone of Fe-deficient roots. OsIRT1 expression was also detected in the ccompanion cells. Analysis using the positron-emitting tracer imaging system showed that rice plants are able to take up both an Fe3+-phytosiderophore and Fe2+. This result indicates that, in addition to absorbing an Fe3+-phytosiderophore, rice possesses a novel Fe-uptake system that directly absorbs the Fe2+, a strategy that is advantageous for growth in submerged conditions.
Ishimaru-2005-OsZIP4, a novel zinc.pdf	OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice	2005	J Exp Bot	Department of Global Agricultural Sciences, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Science, University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Zinc (Zn) is an essential element for the normal growth of plants but information is scarce on the mechanisms whereby Zn is transported in rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants. Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated. Microarray and northern blot analysis revealed that OsZIP4 was highly expressed under conditions of Zn deficiency in roots and shoots. Real-time-PCR revealed that the OsZIP4 transcripts were more abundant than those of OsZIP1 or OsZIP3 in Zn-deficient roots and shoots. OsZIP4 complemented a Zn-uptake-deficient yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant, Deltazrt1,Deltazrt2, indicating that OsZIP4 is a functional transporter of Zn. OsZIP4-synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP) fusion protein was transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells localized to the plasma membrane. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsZIP4 in Zn-deficient rice was expressed in shoots and roots, especially in phloem cells. Furthermore, OsZIP4 transcripts were detected in the meristem of Zn-deficient roots and shoots. These results suggested that OsZIP4 is a Zn transporter that may be responsible for the translocation of Zn within rice plants.
J. Exp. Bot.-2002-Bughio-1677-82.pdf	Cloning an iron-regulated metal transporter from rice	2002	J Exp Bot	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, The University of Tokyo, 11 Yayoi, Bunkyo‐ku, 113-8657 Tokyo, Japan	Rice cDNA and genomic libraries were screened in order to clone an Fe(II) transporter gene. A cDNA clone highly homologous to the Arabidopsis Fe(II) transporter gene IRT1 was isolated from Fe‐deficient rice roots. The cDNA clone was named OsIRT1. A genomic clone corresponding to the cDNA was also obtained, sequenced and analysed. When expressed in yeast cells, OsIRT1 cDNA reversed the growth defects of the yeast iron‐uptake mutant. Northern blot analysis revealed that OsIRT1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in roots and was induced by Fe and Cu‐deficiency. This suggests that OsIRT1 is a functional metal transporter for iron, and is actively engaged in Fe uptake from soils, especially under limiting conditions.
J. Exp. Bot.-2006-Ogo-2867-78.pdf	Isolation and characterization of IRO2, a novel iron-regulated bHLH transcription factor in graminaceous plants	2006	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	To clarify the molecular mechanism that regulates iron (Fe) acquisition in graminaceous plants, a time-course analysis of gene expression during Fe deficiency stress was conducted using a rice 22K oligo-DNA microarray. Twenty-one genes for proteins that function in gene regulation were induced by Fe deficiency. Of these genes, a putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene, named OsIRO2, was strongly expressed in both roots and shoots during Fe deficiency stress. The expression of OsIRO2 was induced exclusively by Fe deficiency, and not by deficiencies in other metals. Expression of the barley HvIRO2 gene, which is a homologue of OsIRO2, was also induced by Fe deficiency. An in silico search revealed that IRO2 is highly conserved among graminaceous plants, which include wheat, sorghum, and maize. The cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) technique revealed that OsIRO2 bound preferentially to the sequence 5'-ACCACGTGGTTTT-3', and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed 5'-CACGTGG-3' as the core sequence for OsIRO2 binding. Sequences similar to the OsIRO2-binding sequence were found upstream of several genes that are involved in Fe acquisition, such as OsNAS1, OsNAS3, OsIRT1, OsFDH, OsAPT1, and IDS3. The core sequence of the OsIRO2-binding sequence occurred more frequently in the upstream regions of Fe deficiency-inducible genes than in the corresponding regions of non-inducible genes. These results suggest that IRO2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression under Fe-deficient conditions.
J. Exp. Bot.-2013-Yang-5009-20.pdf	A receptor-like protein RMC is involved in regulation of iron acquisition in rice	2013	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, PR China.	Iron (Fe) is one of the essential mineral elements for plant growth and development. Acquisition of Fe by plants is mediated by a complex network involving Fe mobilization, uptake by root cells, and transport within plants. Here, we evaluated the role of a previously clarified gene encoding a receptor-like protein from rice, OsRMC, in the regulation of Fe acquisition by comparing Fe concentration, biomass, and expression patterns of genes associated with Fe mobilization and transport in wild-type (WT) rice with those in OsRMC overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown transgenic rice plants. Expression of OsRMC was upregulated in both shoots and roots upon exposure of WT to Fe-deficient medium. Expression levels of OsRMC were positively correlated with Fe concentration in rice plants under both Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient conditions such that overexpression and RNAi lines had higher and lower Fe concentration in both roots and shoots than WT plants, respectively. Moreover, overexpression of OsRMC conferred greater accumulation of Fe in mature seeds under Fe-sufficient conditions. OsRMC may also play a role in regulation of Fe deficiency-induced changes in root growth, as evidenced by greater and smaller root systems of OsRMC overexpression lines and RNAi lines than WT under Fe-deficient conditions, respectively. Several Fe deficiency-responsive genes including OsDMAS1, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAAT1, OsIRT1, OsYSL15, and OsIRO2 were up- and downregulated in OsRMC-overexpressing and RNAi plants compared with WT rice plants. These novel findings highlight an important role of OsRMC played in mediation of Fe acquisition and root growth in rice, particularly under Fe-deficient conditions.
j.1365-3040.2009.01935.x.pdf	Over-expression of OsIRT1 leads to increased iron and zinc accumulations in rice	2009	Plant Cell Environ	Department of Life Science and Functional Genomic Center, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang 790-784, Korea.	Uptake and translocation of micronutrients are essential for plant growth. These micronutrients are also important food components. We generated transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsIRT1 to evaluate its functional roles in metal homeostasis. Those plants showed enhanced tolerance to iron deficiency at the seedling stage. In paddy fields, this over-expression caused plant architecture to be altered. In addition, those plants were sensitive to excess Zn and Cd, indicating that OsIRT1 also transports those metals. As expected, iron and zinc contents were elevated in the shoots, roots and mature seeds of over-expressing plants. This demonstrates that OsIRT1 can be used for enhancing micronutrient levels in rice grains.
j.1365-313X.2009.04015.x.pdf	The rice transcription factor IDEF1 is essential for the early response to iron deficiency, and induces vegetative expression of late embryogenesis abundant genes	2009	Plant J	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Higher plants maintain iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of iron (Fe)-related genes in accordance with Fe availability. The transcription factor IDEF1 regulates the response to Fe deficiency in Oryza sativa (rice) by recognizing CATGC sequences within the Fe deficiency-responsive cis-acting element IDE1. To investigate the function of IDEF1 in detail, we analyzed the response to Fe deficiency in transgenic rice plants exhibiting induced or repressed IDEF1 expression. Fe-deficiency treatment in hydroponic culture revealed that IDEF1 knock-down plants are susceptible to early-stage Fe deficiency, in contrast to IDEF1-induced plants. Time-course expression analyses using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR revealed that the IDEF1 expression level was positively correlated with the level of induction of the Fe utilization-related genes OsIRO2, OsYSL15, OsIRT1, OsYSL2, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsNAS3 and OsDMAS1, just after the onset of Fe starvation. However, this overall transactivation mediated by IDEF1 became less evident in subsequent stages. Microarray and in-silico analyses revealed that genes positively regulated by IDEF1, especially at the early stage, exhibit over-representation of CATGC and IDE1-like elements within the proximal promoter regions. These results indicate the existence of early and subsequent responses to Fe deficiency, with the former requiring IDEF1 more specifically. Proximal regions of IDEF1-regulated gene promoters also showed enrichment of RY elements (CATGCA), which regulate gene expression during seed maturation. The expression of several genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant proteins, including Osem, was induced in Fe-deficient roots and/or leaves in an IDEF1-dependent manner, suggesting a possible function of seed maturation-related genes in Fe-deficient vegetative organs.
j.1469-8137.2011.03910.x.pdf	OsARF12, a transcription activator on auxin response gene, regulates root elongation and affects iron accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa)	2012	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	* Auxin has an important role in maintaining optimal root system architecture (RSA) that can cope with growth reductions of crops caused by water or nutrient shortages. However, the mechanism of controlling RSA remains largely unclear. Here, we found a limiting factor of RSA--OsARF12--an auxin response factor whose knockout led to decreased primary root length in rice (Oryza sativa). * OsARF12 as a transcription activator can facilitate the expression of the auxin response element DR5::GFP, and OsARF12 was inhibited by osa-miRNA167d by transient expression in tobacco and rice callus. * The root elongation zones of osarf12 and osarf12/25, which had lower auxin concentrations, were distinctly shorter than for the wild-type, possibly as a result of decreased expression of auxin synthesis genes OsYUCCAs and auxin efflux carriers OsPINs and OsPGPs. The knockout of OsARF12 also altered the abundance of mitochondrial iron-regulated (OsMIR), iron (Fe)-regulated transporter1 (OsIRT1) and short postembryonic root1 (OsSPR1) in roots of rice, and resulted in lower Fe content. * The data provide evidence for the biological function of OsARF12, which is implicated in regulating root elongation. Our investigation contributes a novel insight for uncovering regulation of RSA and the relationship between auxin response and Fe acquisition.
j.1747-0765.2006.00055.x.pdf	Iron deficiency enhances cadmium uptake and translocation mediated by the Fe2+transporters OsIRT1 and OsIRT2 in rice	2006	Soil Science and Plant Nutrition	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657	Cadmium (Cd) accumulation in rice grains is enhanced if ponded water is released from paddy fields during the reproductive stage (intermittent irrigation). The release of ponded water creates aerobic soil conditions under which Cd becomes soluble and iron (Fe) solubility decreases. We hypothesized that Fe shortage in rice induces Fe uptake and translocation and that Cd is also taken up and translocated throughout this process. Hydroponically cultured Fe-deficient rice absorbed more Cd than did Fe-sufficient rice, and the presence of Fe enhanced the translocation of Cd to the shoots. Yeast mutants expressing OsIRT1 and OsIRT2, which encode the rice Fe2+ transporter, became more sensitive to Cd, suggesting that Cd was absorbed by OsIRT1 and OsIRT2. We discuss the possibility that Cd accumulation in rice grains during the reproductive stage is mediated by the Fe transport system.
PNAS-2007-Ishimaru-7373-8.pdf	Mutational reconstructed ferric chelate reductase confers enhanced tolerance in rice to iron deficiency in calcareous soil	2007	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Global Agricultural Sciences, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Iron (Fe) deficiency is a worldwide agricultural problem on calcareous soils with low-Fe availability due to high soil pH. Rice plants use a well documented phytosiderophore-based system (Strategy II) to take up Fe from the soil and also possess a direct Fe2+ transport system. Rice plants are extremely susceptible to low-Fe supply, however, because of low phytosiderophore secretion and low Fe3+ reduction activity. A yeast Fe3+ chelate-reductase gene refre1/372, selected for better performance at high pH, was fused to the promoter of the Fe-regulated transporter, OsIRT1, and introduced into rice plants. The transgene was expressed in response to a low-Fe nutritional status in roots of transformants. Transgenic rice plants expressing the refre1/372 gene showed higher Fe3+ chelate-reductase activity and a higher Fe-uptake rate than vector controls under Fe-deficient conditions. Consequently, transgenic rice plants exhibited an enhanced tolerance to low-Fe availability and 7.9x the grain yield of nontransformed plants in calcareous soils. This report shows that enhancing the Fe3+ chelate-reductase activity of rice plants that normally have low endogenous levels confers resistance to Fe deficiency.
NA	Comparative transcriptome profile analysis of rice varieties with different tolerance to zinc deficiency	2020	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	CAAS-IRRI Joint Laboratory for Genomics-Assisted Germplasm Enhancement, Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Zinc (Zn) is an indispensable element for rice growth. Zn deficiency results in brown blotches and streaks 2-3 weeks after transplanting, as well as stunting, reduced tillering, and low productivity of rice plants. These processes are controlled by different families of expressed genes. A comparative transcriptome profile analysis was conducted using the roots of two Zn deficiency tolerant varieties (UCP122 and KALIBORO26) and two sensitive varieties (IR26 and IR64) by merging data from untreated control (CK) and Zn deficiency treated samples. Results revealed a total of 4,688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal Zn and deficient conditions, with 2,702 and 1,489 unique DEGs upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified transcription factors (TFs), such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, and bHLH which are important in the regulation of the Zn deficiency response. Furthermore, chitinases, jasmonic acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways were found to be important in the Zn deficiency response. The metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes also appeared to play an important role in conferring tolerance to Zn deficiency. A heavy metal-associated domain-containing protein 7 was associated with tolerance to Zn deficiency and negatively regulated downstream genes. Collectively, our findings provide valuable expression patterns and candidate genes for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to Zn deficiency and for improvements in breeding for tolerance to Zn deficiency in rice.
NA	Effects of Fe and Mn cations on Cd uptake by rice plant in hydroponic culture experiment	2020	PLoS One	Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are nutritional components of rice, plays an important role in its physiological processes and can minimize absorption of cadmium (Cd) in rice. Fe, Mn, and Cd transporters such as CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, OsHMA3, and OsNAAT1 regulate uptake of Cd in rice. However, the effect of exogenous application of Fe, and Mn on the accumulation of Cd and relative expression (RE) of these transporters in rice has not been investigated. Therefore, a hydroponic culture experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of Fe and Mn on Cd uptake and RE of these transporters in rice. The results showed that the Fe and Mn application significantly decreased Cd in the roots and shoots of rice. Whereas, Cd concentration in the rice significantly increased with increasing Cd concentration in the solution. The addition of manganese in the culture medium can reduce the cadmium content of rice roots by 11.9-82.3% and shoots by 11.6-85.0%, while the addition of iron in the culture medium can reduce the cadmium content of rice roots and shoots by 26-65% and 9-683% respectively. Meanwhile, application of sufficient doses of Fe and Cd in solution culture increased RE of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 in roots, whereas expression level of OsHMA3 was decreased. Similarly, expression level of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, and OsNRAMP1 significantly increased in roots in high Cd and Mn deficient treatments. This may be concluded that the Cd increases expression of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 but decreases OsHMA3 expression in rice roots, which resulted in increased Cd uptake in hydroponically grown rice.
