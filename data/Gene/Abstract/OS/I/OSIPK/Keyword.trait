OSIPK|OsCPK29	panicle	Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems	Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and OSIPK coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), respectively
OSIPK|OsCPK29	pollen	Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems	Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and OSIPK coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), respectively
OSIPK|OsCPK29	pollen	Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems	Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while OSIPK expresses in pollen as well as anther wall
OSIPK|OsCPK29	pollen	Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems	Promoter of OSIPA is active during the late stages of pollen development and remains active till the anthesis, whereas, OSIPK promoter is active to a low level in developing anther till the pollen matures
OSIPK|OsCPK29	anther	Promoters of two anther-specific genes confer organ-specific gene expression in a stage-specific manner in transgenic systems	Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while OSIPK expresses in pollen as well as anther wall
