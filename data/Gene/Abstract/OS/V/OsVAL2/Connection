EUI1	OsVAL2	The Intronic cis-Element SE1 Recruits trans-acting Repressor Complexes to Repress the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 in Rice.	 Detailed genetic and molecular analysis of SE1 revealed that this intronic cis-element recruits at least a trans-acting repressor complex, containing the B3 repressors OsVAL2 and OsGD1, the SAP18 co-repressor, and a histone deacetylase OsHDA710, to negatively regulate the expression of Eui1
