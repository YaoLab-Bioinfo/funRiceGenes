OsRLCK107	OsRLCK176|BML	Four receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases regulate development and immunity in rice.	Here, we report the functional characterization of four rice RLCKs-OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107, OsRLCK118, and OsRLCK176 from subfamily VII
OsRLCK107	OsRLCK57	OsRLCK 57, OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118 Positively Regulate Chitin- and PGN-Induced Immunity in Rice.	Here, we further researched the function of the homologous proteins, OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118, in chitin- and PGN immunity in rice
OsRLCK107	OsRLCK57	OsRLCK 57, OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118 Positively Regulate Chitin- and PGN-Induced Immunity in Rice.	OsRLCK57, OsRLCK107 and OsRLCK118, positively regulate chitin- and PGN- induced responses in rice, similar to that observed in OsRLCK176
