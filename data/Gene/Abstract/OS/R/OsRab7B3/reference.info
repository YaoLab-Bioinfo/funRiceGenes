76_120050.pdf	Overexpression ofOsRab7B3, a Small GTP-Binding Protein Gene, Enhances Leaf Senescence in Transgenic Rice	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Muang, Chiang Mai, Thailand.	Rab family proteins are small GTP-binding proteins involved in intracellular trafficking. They play critical roles in several plant development processes. Different expression patterns of 46 Rabs in the rice genome were examined in various rice tissues and in leaves treated with plant growth regulators and under senescence conditions. One of the OsRab genes, OsRab7B3, closely associated with senescence in expression pattern, was chosen for functional analysis. Expression of sGFP under the control of the OsRab7B3 promoter increased in leaves when ABA and NaCl were applied or when kept in dark. In transgenic rice overexpressing OsRab7B3, the senescence-related genes were upregulated and leaf senescence was significantly enhanced under dark conditions. Moreover, leaf yellowing occurred earlier in the transgenic plants than in the wild type at the ripening stage. Hence it is suggested that OsRab7B3 act as a stress-inducible gene that plays an important role in the leaf senescence process.
Plant Cell Physiol-2003-Nahm-1341-9.pdf	Molecular and biochemical analyses of OsRab7, a rice Rab7 homolog	2003	Plant Cell Physiol	Division of Applied Life Science (BK21), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 660-701 Korea.	Rab7 is a small GTP-binding protein important in early to late endosome/lysosome vesicular transport in mammalian cells. We have isolated a Rab7 cDNA clone, OsRab7, from a cold-treated rice cDNA library by the subtraction screening method. The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 206 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of about 23 kDa. Its predicted amino acid sequence shows significantly high identity with the sequences of other Rab7 proteins. His-tagged OsRab7 bound to radiolabeled GTPgammaS in a specific and stoichiometric manner. Biochemical and structural properties of the Rab7 wild type (WT) protein were compared to those of Q67L and T22N mutants. The detergent 3-([3-cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS) increased the guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis activities of Rab7WT. The OsRab7Q67L mutant showed much lower GTPase activity compared to the WT protein untreated with CHAPS, and the T22N mutant showed no GTP binding activity at all. The OsRab7Q67L mutant was constitutively active for guanine nucleotide binding while the T22N mutant (dominant negative) showed no guanine nucleotide binding activity. When bound to GTP, the Rab7WT and the Q67L mutants were protected from tryptic proteolysis. The cleavage pattern of the Rab7T22N mutant, however, was not affected by GTP addition. Northern and Western blot analyses suggested that OsRab7 is distributed in various tissues of rice. Furthermore, expression of a rice Rab7 gene was differentially regulated by various environmental stimuli such as cold, NaCl, dehydration, and ABA. In addition, subcellular localization of OsRab7 was investigated in the Arabidopsis protoplasts by a double-labeling experiment using GFP-fused OsRab7 and FM4-64. GFP-OsRab7 is localized to the vacuolar membrane, suggesting that OsRab7 is implicated in a vesicular transport to the vacuole in plant cells.
NA	Overexpression of Rice Rab7 Gene Improves Drought and Heat Tolerance and Increases Grain Yield in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	Genes (Basel)	Botany Department, Faculty of Science, Tanta University, Tanta 31527, Egypt. mohamed.elesawi@science.tanta.edu.eg.	Rab family proteins play a crucial role in plant developmental processes and tolerance to environmental stresses. The current study investigated whether rice Rab7 (OsRab7) overexpression could improve rice tolerance to drought and heat stress conditions. The OsRab7 gene was cloned and transformed into rice plants. The survival rate, relative water content, chlorophyll content, gas-exchange characteristics, soluble protein content, soluble sugar content, proline content, and activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, APX, POD) of the transgenic rice lines were significantly higher than that of the wild-type. In contrast, the levels of hydrogen peroxide, electrolyte leakage, and malondialdehyde of the transgenic lines were significantly reduced when compared to wild-type. Furthermore, the expression of four genes encoding reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes (OsCATA, OsCATB, OsAPX2, OsSOD-Cu/Zn) and eight genes conferring abiotic stress tolerance (OsLEA3, OsRD29A, OsSNAC1, OsSNAC2, OsDREB2A, OsDREB2B, OsRAB16A, OsRAB16C) was significantly up-regulated in the transformed rice lines as compared to their expression in wild-type. OsRab7 overexpression also increased grain yield in rice. Taken together, the current study indicates that the OsRab7 gene improves grain yield and enhances drought and heat tolerance in transgenic rice by modulating osmolytes, antioxidants and abiotic stress-responsive genes expression. Therefore, OsRab7 gene could be exploited as a promising candidate for improving rice grain yield and stress tolerance.
