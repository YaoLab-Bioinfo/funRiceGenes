NA	Suppression of OsRAD51D results in defects in reproductive development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2014	Plant J	Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Korea.	The cellular roles of RAD51 paralogs in somatic and reproductive growth have been extensively described in a wide range of animal systems and, to a lesser extent, in Arabidopsis, a dicot model plant. Here, the OsRAD51D gene was identified and characterized in rice (Oryza sativa L.), a monocot model crop. In the rice genome, three alternative OsRAD51D mRNA splicing variants, OsRAD51D.1, OsRAD51D.2, and OsRAD51D.3, were predicted. Yeast two-hybrid studies, however, showed that only OsRAD51D.1 interacted with OsRAD51B and OsRAD51C paralogs, suggesting that OsRAD51D.1 is a functional OsRAD51D protein in rice. Loss-of-function osrad51d mutant rice plants displayed normal vegetative growth. However, the mutant plants were defective in reproductive growth, resulting in sterile flowers. Homozygous osrad51d mutant flowers exhibited impaired development of lemma and palea and contained unusual numbers of stamens and stigmas. During early meiosis, osrad51d pollen mother cells (PMCs) failed to form normal homologous chromosome pairings. In subsequent meiotic progression, mutant PMCs represented fragmented chromosomes. The osrad51d pollen cells contained numerous abnormal micro-nuclei that resulted in malfunctioning pollen. The abnormalities of heterozygous mutant and T2 Ubi:RNAi-OsRAD51D RNAi-knock-down transgenic plants were intermediate between those of wild type and homozygous mutant plants. The osrad51d and Ubi:RNAi-OsRAD51D plants contained longer telomeres compared with wild type plants, indicating that OsRAD51D is a negative factor for telomere lengthening. Overall, these results suggest that OsRAD51D plays a critical role in reproductive growth in rice. This essential function of OsRAD51D is distinct from Arabidopsis, in which AtRAD51D is not an essential factor for meiosis or reproductive development.
NA	OsRAD51D promotes homologous pairing and recombination by preventing non-homologous interactions in rice meiosis.	2020	New Phytol	State Key Lab of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101, Beijing, China.	Homologous recombination (HR) is carefully orchestrated to maintain genome integrity. RAD51D has been previously shown to be essential for double-strand break (DSB) repair in mammalian somatic cells. However, the function of RAD51D during meiosis is largely unknown. Here, through detailed analyses of Osrad51d single and double mutants, we pinpoint the specific function of OsRAD51D in coordinating homologous pairing and recombination by preventing non-homologous interactions during meiosis. OsRAD51D is associated with telomeres in both meiocytes and somatic cells. Loss of OsRAD51D leads to significant induction of non-homologous pairing and chromosome entanglements, suggesting its role in suppressing non-homologous interactions. The failed localization of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 in Osrad51d, together with the genetic analysis of Osrad51d Osdmc1a Osdmc1b, indicates that OsRAD51D acts at a very early stage of HR. Observations from the Osrad51d pair1 and Osrad51d ku70 double mutants further demonstrate that non-homologous interactions require DSB formation, but do not depend on the KU70-mediated repair pathway. Moreover, the interplay between OsRAD51D and OsRAD51C indicates both conservation and divergence of their functions in meiosis. Altogether, this work reveals that OsRAD51D plays an essential role in the inhibition of non-homologous connections, thus guaranteeing faithful pairing and recombination during meiosis.
