NA	A Small GTPase, OsRab6a, Is Involved in the Regulation of Iron Homeostasis in Rice	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, P. R. China	Plants have evolved two distinct strategies to acquire Fe from soils. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the Fe acquisition remain largely elusive. There is emerging evidence that small GTPases are involved in the responses of plants to environmental cues. Here, we identified a gene encoding a small GTPase, OsRab6a, in rice and characterized its role in Fe acquisition by generating transgenic rice plants with overexpression and knockdown of OsRab6a. OsRab6a shared conserved functional domains with other known members of Rab subfamily and localized ubiquitously in the cytoplasm and nuclear. The expression of OsRab6a was rapidly and transiently up-regulated by Fe deficiency. No differences in growth and development among the OsRab6a-overexpression, OsRab6a-RNAi and wild-type plants were detected when grown in Fe-sufficient medium. However, overexpression of OsRab6a conferred rice plants greater tolerance to Fe deficiency than RNAi and wild-type plants, as evidenced by higher seedling height, greater biomass, chlorophyll contents and Fe concentrations in shoots, roots and grains in the overexpression lines. Moreover, the overexpression lines exhibited greater root systems than wild-type and RNAi plants in Fe-deficient medium. Exposure to Fe-deficient medium led to up-regulation of OsIRO2, OsIRT1, OsNAS1 and OsNAS2 in both wild-type and the transgenic rice plants, with the magnitude of up-regulation positively correlated with the expression levels of OsRab6a. These results may suggest that OsRab6a plays an important role in the regulation of Fe acquisition in rice plants by modulating physiological processes involved in Fe acquisition and root system architecture in response to Fe-deficient medium.
NA	A rice small GTPase, OsRab6a, is involved in the regulation of grain yield and iron nutrition in response to CO2 enrichment.	2020	J Exp Bot.

Despite extensive studies on the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) on rice, the molecular players and signaling events underlying adaptation of rice plants to elevated [CO2] remains largely elusive. Here, we report that the OsRab6a gene encoding a small GTPase is involved in the regulation of rice growth, seed yield and iron (Fe) accumulation in response to elevated [CO2] using wild-type and transgenic rice plants of OsRab6a-overexpressing and OsRab6a-RNAi. No differences in growth and grain yield among wild-type and the transgenic plants were detected under ambient [CO2] conditions. When growing in elevated [CO2] conditions, growth and grain yield of wild-type and OsRab6a-overexpression rice plants were enhanced, with the OsRab6a-overexpression rice plants exhibiting higher growth and yield than their wild-type counterparts. In contrast, there were no effects of elevated [CO2] on growth and grain yield of OsRab6a-RNAi plants. Photosynthetic rates of both WT and OsRab6a-overexpressing plants were stimulated by elevated [CO2], with the magnitude of increase being higher in OsRab6a overexpression. Fe concentrations in vegetative tissues and grains of wild-type and transgenic rice plants were reduced by elevated [CO2], and the magnitude of decrease was lower in overexpression than that of wild-type and RNAi plants. The genes associated with Fe acquisition Fe in OsRab6a-overexpressing lines exhibited greater expression than those in WT and OsRab6a-RNAi plants under elevated [CO2]. By analyzing data with the Dunnett's multiple comparison test, our results suggest that OsRab6a is an important molecular regulator underlying rice adaptation to elevated [CO2] by regulating photosynthesis and Fe accumulation.
