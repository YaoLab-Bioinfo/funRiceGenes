OsRING-1|OsATL38	blast	Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene	A novel blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger protein gene OsRING-1 was cloned from rice by cDNA library screening
OsRING-1|OsATL38	root	Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene	Tissue expression analysis showed that OsRING-1 was constitutively strongly expressed in roots, but faintly in stems, leaves and sheaths
OsRING-1|OsATL38	sheath	Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene	Tissue expression analysis showed that OsRING-1 was constitutively strongly expressed in roots, but faintly in stems, leaves and sheaths
OsRING-1|OsATL38	stem	Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene	Tissue expression analysis showed that OsRING-1 was constitutively strongly expressed in roots, but faintly in stems, leaves and sheaths
OsRING-1|OsATL38	ethylene	Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene	The promoter sequence analysis of OsRING-1 gene revealed that some ABA, GA, ethylene, wound, drought, heat stress and pathogen infection responsive elements were found within the OsRING-1 promoter region
OsRING-1|OsATL38	drought	Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene	The promoter sequence analysis of OsRING-1 gene revealed that some ABA, GA, ethylene, wound, drought, heat stress and pathogen infection responsive elements were found within the OsRING-1 promoter region
OsRING-1|OsATL38	transcription regulator	Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene	Taken together, OsRING-1, as a novel C3H2C3-type zinc finger protein involved in many stress responses in rice might plays a role as a transcription regulator in plant stress response signal transduction pathways
OsRING-1|OsATL38	 ja 	Molecular cloning and characterization of a rice blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger gene	Northern analysis showed that OsRING-1 was induced in different degree by pathogen infections, SA, ABA, JA and ethephon (ET) treatments
