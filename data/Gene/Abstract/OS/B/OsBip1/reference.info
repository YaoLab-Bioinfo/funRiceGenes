Binding protein (BiP) is a chaperone protein involved in the folding of secretory proteins in the ER lumen. OsBiP1 is constitutively expressed in various tissues, whereas the expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 (OsBiP4&5) is not detected in any tissue under normal conditions. However, expression of OsBiP4&5 was highly and specifically activated under ER stress conditions induced by DTT treatment, OsBiP1 knockdown, OsBiP1 overexpression, OsIRE1 overexpression, or various exogenous recombinant proteins in transgenic rice. In contrast, OsBiP4&5 did not accumulate in OsIRE1 knockdown transgenic rice even after DTT treatment. When the subcellular localization of OsBiP4&5 was investigated in seed endosperm cells under the ER stress condition, OsBiP4&5 were localized to the ER, but did not participate in ER-derived protein body (PB-I) formation in a different manner to OsBiP1. These results indicate that OsBiP4&5 levels were positively correlated with stress levels in the ER. Taken together, these results suggest that OsBiP4&5 are ER stress-related BiP proteins that are regulated by OsIRE1/OsbZIP50 pathway and that they may have a distinct function from that of OsBiP1 in rice.
Hayashi-2012-Signal transduction.pdf	Signal transduction by IRE1-mediated splicing of bZIP50 and other stress sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response of rice	2012	Plant J	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1 transduces signals by inducing the unconventional splicing of mRNAs encoding key transcription factors: HAC1 in yeast and XBP1 in animals. However, no HAC1 or XBP1 homologues have been found in plants, and until recently the substrate for plant IRE1 has remained unknown. This study demonstrates that the Oryza sativa (rice) OsbZIP50 transcription factor, an orthologue of Arabidopsis AtbZIP60, is regulated by IRE1-mediated splicing of its RNA. Despite the presence of a transcriptional activation domain, OsbZIP50 protein is not translocated into the nucleus efficiently in the absence of OsbZIP50 mRNA splicing. Unconventional splicing of OsbZIP50 mRNA causes a frame shift, which results in the appearance of a nuclear localization signal in the newly translated OsbZIP50. OsbZIP50 mRNA is spliced in a similar manner to HAC1 and XBP1 mRNAs; however, this splicing has very different effects on the translation products, a finding that shows the diversity of IRE1-related transcription factors in eukaryotes. In addition, the expression of OsbZIP50 is affected by ER stress sensor proteins OsIRE1, OsbZIP39 and OsbZIP60. ER stress-related genes differ with respect to their dependency on OsbZIP50 for their expression. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant ER stress response.
j.1365-313X.2010.04453.x.pdf	Expression of ER quality control-related genes in response to changes in BiP1 levels in developing rice endosperm	2011	Plant J	Transgenic Crop Research and Development Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Binding protein (BiP) is the key chaperone involved in folding of secretory proteins such as seed storage proteins in the ER lumen. To obtain functional information about BiP1, a gene that is predominantly expressed during rice seed maturation, we generated several transgenic rice plants in which various levels of BiP1 protein accumulated in an endosperm-specific manner. Severe suppression (BiP1 KD) or significant over-expression (BiP1 OEmax) of BiP1 not only altered seed phenotype and the intracellular structure of endosperm cells, but also reduced seed storage protein content, starch accumulation and grain weight. Microarray and RT-PCR analyses indicated that expression of many chaperone and co-chaperone genes was induced in transgenic plants, with more prominent expression in the BiP1 KD line than in the BiP1 OEmax line. Transcriptional induction of most chaperones was observed in calli treated with dithiothreitol or tunicamycin, treatments that trigger ER stress, indicating that induction of the chaperone genes in transgenic rice was caused by an ER stress response. In transient assays using rice protoplasts, the ortholog (Os06g0622700) of the AtbZIP60 transcription factor was shown to be involved in activation of some chaperone genes. Slight increases in the BiP1 level compared with wild-type, accompanied by increased levels of calnexin and protein disulfide isomerase-like proteins, resulted in significant enhancement of seed storage protein content, without any change in intracellular structure or seed phenotype. Judicious modification of BiP1 levels in transgenic rice can provide suitable conditions for the production of secretory proteins by alleviating ER stress.
pone.0009262.pdf	Overexpression of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP3 regulates XA21-mediated innate immunity in rice	2010	PLoS One	Department of Plant Pathology, University of California Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.	Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) activates the innate immune response. Although PRR-mediated signaling events are critical to the survival of plants and animals, secretion and localization of PRRs have not yet been clearly elucidated. Here we report the in vivo interaction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone BiP3 with the rice XA21 PRR, which confers resistance to the Gram negative bacterium, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). We show that XA21 is glycosylated and is primarily localized to the ER and also to the plasma membrane (PM). In BiP3-overexpressing rice plants, XA21-mediated immunity is compromised, XA21 stability is significantly decreased, and XA21 proteolytic cleavage is inhibited. BiP3 overexpression does not affect the general rice defense response, cell death or brassinolide-induced responses. These results indicate that BiP3 regulates XA21 protein stability and processing and that this regulation is critical for resistance to Xoo.
NA	OsFes1C, a potential nucleotide exchange factor for OsBiP1, is involved in the ER and salt stress responses 	2021	Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control system monitors protein homeostasis and relies on the activity of many molecular chaperones. Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) is a major ER luminal chaperone that is involved in most functions of the organelle. BiP activity is tightly regulated by nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). However, information about NEFs in plants is limited. We obtained a Fes1-like protein (OsFes1C) through isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation-based proteomics analysis of ER-stressed rice (Oryza sativa) seeds. Unlike its homologs in yeast and mammals, which are located in the cytosol and respond to heat stress, OsFes1C is an ER membrane protein and responds to ER and salt stresses. OsFes1C interacts directly with OsBiP1 and the interaction is inhibited by ATP but promoted by ADP, suggesting that OsFes1C acts as a potential NEF of OsBiP1 in vivo. Overexpression or suppression of OsFes1C led to hypersensitivity to ER stress and affected the growth of rice. Furthermore, we established that OsFes1C directly interacts with a putative salt response protein and is involved in the salt response. Taken together, our study marks an important step toward elucidating the functional mechanisms of an identified ER stress response factor in rice.
