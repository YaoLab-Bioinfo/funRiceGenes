010008034.pdf	Aroma in rice: genetic analysis of a quantitative trait	1996	Theor Appl Genet	ORSTOM-LRGAPT, BP 5045 34032, Montpellier Cedex, 1, France.	A new approach was developed which succeeded in tagging for the first time a major gene and two QTLs controlling grain aroma in rice. It involved a combination of two techniques, quantification of volatile compounds in the cooking water by gas chromatography, and molecular marker mapping. Four types of molecular marker were used (RFLPs, RAPDs, STSs, isozymes). Evaluation and mapping were performed on a doubled haploid line population which (1) conferred a precise character evaluation by enabling the analysis of large quantities of grains per genotype and (2) made possible the comparison of gas chromatography results and sensitive tests. The population size (135 lines) provided a good mapping precision. Several markers on chromosome 8 were found to be closely linked to a major gene controlling the presence of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (AcPy), the main compound of rice aroma. Moreover, our results showed that AcPy concentration in plants is regulated by at least two chromosomal regions. Estimations of recombination fractions on chromosome 8 were corrected for strong segregation distortion. This study confirms that AcPy is the major component of aroma. Use of the markers linked to AcPy major gene and QTLs for marker-assisted selection by successive backcrosses may be envisaged.

Although rice (Oryza sativa L.) produces little glycine betaine (GB), it has two betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH; EC 1.2.1.8) gene homologs (OsBADH1 and OsBADH2). We found that OsBADH1 catalyzes the oxidation of acetaldehyde efficiently, while the activity of OsBADH2 is extremely low. The accumulation of OsBADH1 mRNA decreases following submergence treatment, but quickly recovers after re-aeration. We confirmed that OsBADH1 localizes in peroxisomes. In this paper, a possible physiological function of OsBADH1 in the oxidation of acetaldehyde produced by catalase in rice plant peroxisomes is discussed.
1-s2.0-S0300908412001435-main.pdf	Dissecting substrate specificity of two rice BADH isoforms: Enzyme kinetics, docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies	2012	Biochimie	Departmant of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University, Chatuchak, Bangkok 10900, Thailand.	Fragrance rice (Oryza sativa) contains two isoforms of BADH, named OsBADH1 and OsBADH2. OsBADH1 is implicated in acetaldehyde oxidation in rice plant peroxisomes, while the non-functional OsBADH2 is believed to be involved in the accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, the major compound of aroma in fragrance rice. In the present study, site-directed mutagenesis, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies were used to investigate the substrate specificity towards Bet-ald and GAB-ald. Consistent with our previous study, kinetics data indicated that the enzymes catalyze the oxidation of GAB-ald more efficiently than Bet-ald and the OsBADH1 W172F and OsBADH2 W170F mutants displayed a higher catalytic efficiency towards GAB-ald. Molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations for the first time provided models for aldehyde substrate-bound complexes of OsBADHs. The amino acid residues, E262, L263, C296 and W461 of OsBADH1 and E260, L261, C294 and W459 of OsBADH2 located within 5 A of the OsBADH active site mainly interacted with GAB-ald forming strong hydrogen bonds in both OsBADH isoforms. Residues W163, N164, Q294, C296 and F397 of OsBADH1-Bet-ald and Y163, M167, W170, E260, S295 and C453 of OsBADH2-Bet-ald formed the main interaction sites while E260 showed an interaction energy of -14.21 kcal/mol. Unconserved A290 in OsBADH1 and W288 in OsBADH2 appeared to be important for substrate recognition similar to that observed in PsAMADHs. Overall, the results here help to explain how two homologous rice BADHs recognize the aldehyde substrate differently, a key property to their biological role.
1-s2.0-S0888754312002303-main.pdf	Haplotype variation at Badh2, the gene determining fragrance in rice	2012	Genomics	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	Fragrance is an important component of end-use quality in rice. A set of 516 fragrant rice accessions were genotyped and over 80% of them carried the badh2.7 allele. A subset of 144 mostly fragrant accessions, including nine of Oryza rufipogon, was then subjected to a detailed diversity and haplotype analysis. The level of linkage disequilibrium in the Badh2 region was higher among the fragrant accessions. Re-sequencing in the Badh2 region showed that badh2.7, badh2.2 and badh2.4-5 all arose in the japonica genepool, and spread later into the indica genepool as a result of deliberate crossing. However, loss-of-function alleles of Badh2 are also found in the indica genepools, and then transferred into japonica. Evidence for three new possible FNPs was obtained from the Badh2 sequence of 62 fragrant accessions. Based on these data, we have elaborated a model for the evolution of Badh2 and its participation in the rice domestication process.
10.1007-BF00227391.pdf	RFLP tagging of a gene for aroma in rice	1992	Theor Appl Genet	Department of Plant Breeding and Biometry, 252 Emerson Hall, Cornell University, 14853, Ithaca, NY, USA.	We report here the identification of a DNA marker closely linked to a gene for aroma in rice. The DNA marker was identified by testing 126 mapped rice genomic, cDNA, and oat cDNA, clones as hybridization probes against Southern blots, consisting of DNA from a pair of nearly isogenic lines (NILs) with or without the aroma gene. Chromosomal segments introgressed from the donor genome were distinguished by RFLPs between the NILs. Linkage association of the clone with the gene was verified using an F3 segregating for aroma. Cosegregation of the scented phenotype and donor-derived allele indicated the presence of linkage between the DNA marker and the gene. RFLP analysis showed that the gene is linked to a single-copy DNA clone, RG28, on chromosome 8, at a distance of 4.5 cM. The availability of a linked DNA marker may facilitate early selection for the aroma gene in rice breeding programs.
122_2008_Article_780.pdf	Characterization of the major fragance gene from an aromatic japonica rice and analysis of its diversity in Asian cultivated rice	2008	Theor Appl Genet	UMR 5096, IRD-CNRS-Universite de Perpignan, Laboratoire Genome et Developpement des Plantes, Perpignan, France.	In Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), aroma is one of the most valuable traits in grain quality and 2-ACP is the main volatile compound contributing to the characteristic popcorn-like odour of aromatic rices. Although the major locus for grain fragrance (frg gene) has been described recently in Basmati rice, this gene has not been characterised in true japonica varieties and molecular information available on the genetic diversity and evolutionary origin of this gene among the different varieties is still limited. Here we report on characterisation of the frg gene in the Azucena variety, one of the few aromatic japonica cultivars. We used a RIL population from a cross between Azucena and IR64, a non-aromatic indica, the reference genomic sequence of Nipponbare (japonica) and 93-11 (indica) as well as an Azucena BAC library, to identify the major fragance gene in Azucena. We thus identified a betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase gene, badh2, as the candidate locus responsible for aroma, which presented exactly the same mutation as that identified in Basmati and Jasmine-like rices. Comparative genomic analyses showed very high sequence conservation between Azucena and Nipponbare BADH2, and a MITE was identified in the promotor region of the BADH2 allele in 93-11. The badh2 mutation and MITE were surveyed in a representative rice collection, including traditional aromatic and non-aromatic rice varieties, and strongly suggested a monophylogenetic origin of this badh2 mutation in Asian cultivated rices. Altogether these new data are discussed here in the light of current hypotheses on the origin of rice genetic diversity.

Genetic studies and physical fine mapping reveal that a candidate gene (fgr/OsBADH2) homologous to betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase is responsible for aroma metabolism in fragrant rice varieties, but the direct evidence demonstrating the functions of OsBADH2 is lacking. To elucidate the physiological roles of OsBADH2, sequencing approach and RNA interference (RNAi) technique were employed to analyze allelic variation and functions of OsBADH2 gene in aroma production. Semi-quantitative, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), as well as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were conducted to determine the expression levels of OsBADH2 and the fragrant compound in wild type and transgenic OsBADH2-RNAi repression lines, respectively. RESULTS: The results showed that multiple mutations identical to fgr allele occur in the 13 fragrant rice accessions across China; OsBADH2 is expressed constitutively, with less expression abundance in mature roots; the disrupted OsBADH2 by RNA interference leads to significantly increased 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline production. CONCLUSION: We have found that the altered expression levels of OsBADH2 gene influence aroma accumulation, and the prevalent aromatic allele probably has a single evolutionary origin.
f-67-01221.pdf	Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of recombinant betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (OsBADH2), a protein involved in jasmine aroma, from Thai fragrant rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2011	Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun	Synchrotron Light Research Institute (Public Organization), 111 University Avenue, Muang District, Nakhon Ratchasima 30000, Thailand. buabarn@slri.or.th	Fragrant rice (Oryza sativa L.) betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (OsBADH2) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of fragrance aroma compounds. The extremely low activity of OsBADH2 in catalyzing the oxidation of acetaldehyde is believed to be crucial for the accumulation of the volatile compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) in many scented plants, including fragrant rice. Recombinant fragrant rice OsBADH2 was expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal hexahistidine fusion protein, purified using Ni Sepharose affinity chromatography and crystallized using the microbatch method. Initial crystals were obtained within 24 h using 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5 with 30%(w/v) PEG 4000 and 0.2 M magnesium chloride as the precipitating agent at 291 K. Crystal quality was improved when the enzyme was cocrystallized with NAD(+). Improved crystals were grown in 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.4, 24%(w/v) PEG 4000 and 0.2 M ammonium chloride and diffracted to beyond 2.95 A resolution after being cooled in a stream of N(2) immediately prior to X-ray diffraction experiments. The crystals belonged to space group C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 66.03, b = 183.94, c = 172.28 A. An initial molecular-replacement solution has been obtained and refinement is in progress.
gene for fragrance in rice.pdf	The gene for fragrance in rice	2005	Plant Biotechnol J	Centre for Plant Conservation Genetics, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia.	The flavour or fragrance of basmati and jasmine rice is associated with the presence of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline. A recessive gene (fgr) on chromosome 8 of rice has been linked to this important trait. Here, we show that a gene with homology to the gene that encodes betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BAD) has significant polymorphisms in the coding region of fragrant genotypes relative to non-fragrant genotypes. The accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in fragrant rice genotypes may be explained by the presence of mutations resulting in a loss of function of the fgr gene product. The allele in fragrant genotypes has a mutation introducing a stop codon upstream of key amino acid sequences conserved in other BADs. The fgr gene corresponds to the gene encoding BAD2 in rice, while BAD1 is encoded by a gene on chromosome 4. BAD has been linked to stress tolerance in plants. However, the apparent loss of function of BAD2 does not seem to limit the growth of fragrant rice genotypes. Fragrance in domesticated rice has apparently originated from a common ancestor and may have evolved in a genetically isolated population, or may be the outcome of a separate domestication event. This is an example of effective human selection for a recessive trait during domestication.
tpc2001850.pdf	Badh2, encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase, inhibits the biosynthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, a major component in rice fragrance	2008	Plant Cell	National Maize Improvement Center of China, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, People's Republic of China.	In rice (Oryza sativa), the presence of a dominant Badh2 allele encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH2) inhibits the synthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), a potent flavor component in rice fragrance. By contrast, its two recessive alleles, badh2-E2 and badh2-E7, induce 2AP formation. Badh2 was found to be transcribed in all tissues tested except for roots, and the transcript was detected at higher abundance in young, healthy leaves than in other tissues. Multiple Badh2 transcript lengths were detected, and the complete, full-length Badh2 transcript was much less abundant than partial Badh2 transcripts. 2AP levels were significantly reduced in cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-driven transgenic lines expressing the complete, but not the partial, Badh2 coding sequences. In accordance, the intact, full-length BADH2 protein (503 residues) appeared exclusively in nonfragrant transgenic lines and rice varieties. These results indicate that the full-length BADH2 protein encoded by Badh2 renders rice nonfragrant by inhibiting 2AP biosynthesis. The BADH2 enzyme was predicted to contain three domains: NAD binding, substrate binding, and oligomerization domains. BADH2 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, where it is predicted to catalyze the oxidization of betaine aldehyde, 4-aminobutyraldehyde (AB-ald), and 3-aminopropionaldehyde. The presence of null badh2 alleles resulted in AB-ald accumulation and enhanced 2AP biosynthesis. In summary, these data support the hypothesis that BADH2 inhibits 2AP biosynthesis by exhausting AB-ald, a presumed 2AP precursor.
zpq14444.pdf	The origin and evolution of fragrance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.	Fragrance in the grain is one of the most highly valued grain quality traits in rice, yet the origin and evolution of the betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (BADH2) underlying this trait remains unclear. In this study, we identify eight putatively nonfunctional alleles of the BADH2 gene and show that these alleles have distinct geographic and genetic origins. Despite multiple origins of the fragrance trait, a single allele, badh2.1, is the predominant allele in virtually all fragrant rice varieties today, including the widely recognized Basmati and Jasmine types. Haplotype analysis allowed us to establish a single origin of the badh2.1 allele within the Japonica varietal group and demonstrate the introgression of this allele from Japonica to Indica. Basmati-like accessions were nearly identical to the ancestral Japonica haplotype across a 5.3-Mb region flanking BADH2 regardless of their fragrance phenotype, demonstrating a close evolutionary relationship between Basmati varieties and the Japonica gene pool. These results clarify the relationships among fragrant rice varieties and challenge the traditional assumption that the fragrance trait arose in the Indica varietal group.

Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (BADH2) is believed to be involved in the accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), one of the major aromatic compounds in fragrant rice. The enzyme can oxidize omega-aminoaldehydes to the corresponding omega-amino acids. This study was carried out to investigate the function of wild-type BADHs and four BADH2 mutants: BADH2_Y420, containing a Y420 insertion similar to BADH2.8 in Myanmar fragrance rice, BADH2_C294A, BADH2_E260A and BADH2_N162A, consisting of a single catalytic-residue mutation. Our results showed that the BADH2_Y420 mutant exhibited less catalytic efficiency towards gamma-aminobutyraldehyde but greater efficiency towards betaine aldehyde than wild-type. We hypothesized that this point mutation may account for the accumulation of gamma-aminobutyraldehyde/Delta(1)-pyrroline prior to conversion to 2AP, generating fragrance in Myanmar rice. In addition, the three catalytic-residue mutants confirmed that residues C294, E260 and N162 were involved in the catalytic activity of BADH2 similar to those of other BADHs.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs11103-008-9381-x.pdf	Inactivation of an aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase is responsible for fragrance in rice	2008	Plant Mol Biol	Centre for Plant Conservation Genetics, Southern Cross University, Military Road, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia.	Rice (Oryza sativa) has two betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase homologs, BAD1 and BAD2, encoded on chromosome four and chromosome eight respectively. BAD2 is responsible for the characteristic aroma of fragrant rice. Complementary DNA clones of both BAD1 and BAD2 were isolated and expressed in E. coli. BAD2 had optimum activity at pH 10, little to no affinity towards N-acetyl-gamma-aminobutyraldehyde (NAGABald) with a Km of approximately 10 mM and moderate affinity towards gamma-guanidinobutyraldehyde (GGBald) and betaine aldehyde (bet-ald) with Km values of approximately 260 microM and 63 microM respectively. A lower Km of approximately 9 microM was observed with gamma-aminobutyraldehyde (GABald), suggesting BAD2 has a higher affinity towards this substate in vivo. The enzyme encoded on chromosome four, BAD1, had optimum activity at pH 9.5, showed little to no affinity towards bet-ald with a Km of 3 mM and had moderate affinity towards GGBald, NAGABald and GABald with Km values of approximately 545, 420 and 497 microM respectively. BAD1 had a half life roughly double that of BAD2. We discuss the implications of these findings on the pathway of fragrance generation in Basmati and Jasmine rice and the potential of rice to accumulate the osmoprotectant glycine betaine.
NA	Creation of fragrant rice by targeted knockout of the OsBADH2 gene using TALEN technology.	2015	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Fragrant rice is favoured worldwide because of its agreeable scent. The presence of a defective badh2 allele encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH2) results in the synthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), which is a major fragrance compound. Here, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were engineered to target and disrupt the OsBADH2 gene. Six heterozygous mutants (30%) were recovered from 20 transgenic hygromycin-resistant lines. Sanger sequencing confirmed that these lines had various indel mutations at the TALEN target site. All six transmitted the BADH2 mutations to the T1 generation; and four T1 mutant lines tested also efficiently transmitted the mutations to the T2 generation. Mutant plants carrying only the desired DNA sequence change but not the TALEN transgene were obtained by segregation in the T1 and T2 generations. The 2AP content of rice grains of the T1 lines with homozygous mutations increased from 0 to 0.35-0.75Â mg/kg, which was similar to the content of a positive control variety harbouring the badh2-E7 mutation. We also simultaneously introduced three different pairs of TALENs targeting three separate rice genes into rice cells by bombardment and obtained lines with mutations in one, two and all three genes. These results indicate that targeted mutagenesis using TALENs is a useful approach to creating important agronomic traits.
NA	Resequencing Reveals Different Domestication Rate for BADH1 and BADH2 in Rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	PLoS One	Department of Plant Resources, College of Industrial Science, Kongju National University, Yesan, Republic of Korea.	BADH1 and BADH2 are two homologous genes, encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase in rice. In the present study, we scanned BADHs sequences of 295 rice cultivars, and 10 wild rice accessions to determine the polymorphisms, gene functions and domestication of these two genes. A total of 16 alleles for BADH1 and 10 alleles for BADH2 were detected in transcribed region of cultivars and wild species. Association study showed that BADH1 has significant correlation with salt tolerance in rice during germination stage, the SNP (T/A) in exon 4 is highly correlated with salt tolerance index (STI) (P&lt;10-4). While, BADH2 was only responsible for rice fragrance, of which two BADH2 alleles (8 bp deletion in exon 7 and C/T SNP in exon 13) explain 97% of aroma variation in our germplasm. Theses indicate that there are no overlapping functions between the two homologous genes. In addition, a large LD block was detected in BADH2 region, however, there was no large LD blocks in a 4-Mb region of BADH1. We found that BADH2 region only showed significant bias in Tajima's D value from the balance. Extended haplotype homozygosity study revealed fragrant accessions had a large LD block that extended around the mutation site (8 bp deletion in exon 7) of BADH2, while both of the BADH1 alleles (T/A in exon 4) did not show large extended LD block. All these results suggested that BADH2 was domesticated during rice evolution, while BADH1 was not selected by human beings.
NA	Whole genome sequencing of Oryza sativa L. cv. Seeragasamba identifies a new fragrance allele in rice.	2017	PLoS One	Genomics Laboratory, Department of Genetic Engineering, SRM University, Kattankulathur, India.	Fragrance of rice is an important trait that confers a large economic benefit to the farmers who cultivate aromatic rice varieties. Several aromatic rice varieties have limited geographic distribution, and are endowed with variety-specific unique fragrances. BADH2 was identified as a fragrance gene in 2005, and it is essential to identify the fragrance alleles from diverse geographical locations and genetic backgrounds. Seeragasamba is a short-grain aromatic rice variety of the indica type, which is cultivated in a limited area in India. Whole genome sequencing of this variety identified a new badh2 allele (badh2-p) with an 8 bp insertion in the promoter region of the BADH2 gene. When the whole genome sequences of 76 aromatic varieties in the 3000 rice genome project were analyzed, the badh2-p allele was present in 13 varieties (approximately 17%) of both indica and japonica types. In addition, the badh2-p allele was present in 17 varieties that already had the loss-of-function allele, badh2-E7. Taken together, the frequency of badh2-p allele (approximately 40%) was found to be greater than that of the badh2-E7 allele (approximately 34%) among the aromatic rice varieties. Therefore, it is suggested to include badh2-p as a predominant allele when screening for fragrance alleles in aromatic rice varieties.
NA	Structural insights into betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH2) from Oryza sativa explored by modeling and simulations.	2018	Sci Rep	Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University, Chatuchak, Bangkok, 10900, Thailand.	Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (BADH2) plays a key role in the accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), a fragrant compound in rice (Oryza sativa). BADH2 catalyses the oxidation of aminoaldehydes to carboxylic acids. An inactive BADH2 is known to promote fragrance in rice. The 3D structure and atomic level protein-ligand interactions are currently unknown. Here, the 3D dimeric structure of BADH2 was modeled using homology modeling. Furthermore, two 0.5 ¦Ìs simulations were performed to explore the nature of BADH2 dimer structurally and dynamically. Each monomer comprises of 3 domains (substrate-binding, NAD+-binding, and oligomerization domains). The NAD+-binding domain is the most mobile. A scissor-like motion was observed between the monomers. Inside the binding pocket, N162 and E260 are tethered by strong hydrogen bonds to residues in close proximity. In contrast, the catalytic C294 is very mobile and interacts occasionally with N162. The flexibility of the nucleophilic C294 could facilitate the attack of free carbonyl on an aldehyde substrate. Key inter-subunit salt bridges contributing to dimerization were also identified. E487, D491, E492, K498, and K502 were found to form strong salt bridges with charged residues on the adjacent monomer. Specifically, the nearly permanent R430-E487 hydrogen bond (&gt;90%) highlights its key role in dimer association. Structural and dynamic insights of BADH2 obtained here could play a role in the improvement of rice fragrance, which could lead to an enhancement in rice quality and market price.
NA	RNAi-mediated down regulation of BADH2 gene for expression of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in non-scented indica rice IR-64 (Oryza sativa L.).	2020	3 Biotech	1Department of Botany, Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune, 411007 India.	2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) is a principal aroma compound in scented rice and a mutation in betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (OsBADH2) is responsible aroma in scented rice. The present study was aimed at inducing 2AP production in non-scented indica rice cultivar IR-64 by silencing OsBADH2 via RNAi technique. A vector pBSK was used for the construction of RNAi cassette and pRI101ON as a binary vector. Agrobacterium (GV3101)-mediated transformation was done using embryogenic calli of IR-64. The resultant transgenic lines showed up to 14-fold reduction in expression of OsBADH2 gene and 50% inhibition in enzyme activity. Gas chromatography (GC-MS) analyses showed a significant amount of 2AP production in RNAi callus, leaves, and seeds of IR-64. A total 39 volatile compounds were identified from the control and RNAi seeds of IR-64. Among them, octanal and 2-pentylfuron were found to be increased (30-40%) in RNAi seeds of IR-64. The content of precursors, proline, and methylglyoxal increased substantially, whereas GABA content reduced up to 25% in transgenic IR-64 lines. The study demonstrated that RNAi approach could be successfully used for imparting pleasant aroma character in non-scented indica rice cultivars.

Lines by CRISPR/Cas9 Targeted Mutagenesis of Three Homoeologs of Cytochrome P450 Gene Family and OsBADH2 and Transcriptome and Proteome Profiling of Revealed Changes Triggered by Mutations	2020	Plants (Basel)	College of Agriculture, State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, Guangxi University, Nanning 530004, China.	The significant increase in grain yield and quality are often antagonistic but a constant demand for breeders and consumers. Some genes related to cytochrome P450 family are known for rice organ growth but their role in controlling grain yield is still unknown. Here, we generated new rice mutants with high yield and improved aroma by simultaneously editing three cytochrome P450 homoeologs (Os03g0603100, Os03g0568400, and GL3.2) and OsBADH2 with the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and RNA-sequencing and proteomic analysis were performed to unveil the subsequent changes. High mutation efficiency was achieved in both target sites of each gene and the mutations were predominantly only deletions, while insertions were rare, and no mutations were detected in the five most likely off-target sites against each sgRNA. Mutants exhibited increased grain size, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) content, and grain cell numbers while there was no change in other agronomic traits. Transgene-DNA-free mutant lines appeared with a frequency of 44.44% and homozygous mutations were stably transmitted, and bi-allelic and heterozygous mutations followed Mendelian inheritance, while the inheritance of chimeric mutations was unpredictable. Deep RNA sequencing and proteomic results revealed the regulation of genes and proteins related to cytochrome P450 family, grain size and development, and cell cycle. The KEGG and hub-gene and protein network analysis showed that the gene and proteins related to ribosomal and photosynthesis pathways were mainly enriched, respectively. Our findings provide a broad and detailed basis to understand the role of CRISPR/Cas9 in rice yield and quality improvement.
