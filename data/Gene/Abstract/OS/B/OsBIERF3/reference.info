We isolated and identified four rice genes, OsBIERF1 to OsBIERF4 (Oryza sativa benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced ethylene responsive transcriptional factors (ERF)) and analyzed their expressions in rice disease resistance response and under various abiotic stress conditions. The OsBIERF1-4 proteins contain conserved ERF domains, but are categorized into different classes of the previously characterized ERF proteins based on their structural organizations. OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF2 belong to Classes I and II, respectively; while OsBIRERF1 and OsBIERF4 are members of Class IV. OsBIERF3 could bind specifically to the GCC box sequence and was targeted to nucleus when transiently expressed in onion epidermis cells. Expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was induced by treatments with BTH and salicylic acid, chemical inducers capable of inducing disease resistance response in rice. In the BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, as compared with those in water-treated seedlings. OsBIERF1 and OsBIERF3 were activated in an incompatible interaction but not in compatible interaction between rice and M. grisea. Moreover, OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 were also up-regulated by salt, cold, drought and wounding. These results suggest that OsBIERF proteins may participate in different signaling pathways that mediate disease resistance response and stress responses to abiotic factors.
1-s2.0-S0885576506000087-main.pdf	Overexpression of the rice EREBP-like gene OsBIERF3 enhances disease resistance and salt tolerance in transgenic tobacco	2005	Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology	Institute of Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310029, People's Republic of China	The rice OsBIERF3 encodes a protein belonging to the ethylene-responsive element binding protein (EREBP) transcription factor family and was shown to be induced by treatments with chemical inducers of disease resistance response, infection with the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, and by treatments with some abiotic stress conditions, e.g. salt and cold. To better understand the function of OsBIERF3 in disease resistance response and abiotic tolerance, we overexpressed the OsBIERF3 gene in tobacco by Agrobacterium-mediated leaf disc transformation with a construct containing the OsBIERF3 ORF under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Disease resistance assays showed that the transgenic tobacco plants enhanced disease resistance against infection by tomato mosaic virus and the bacterial wild fire pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. Elevated level of defense-related PR-1a gene expression was also detected in the transgenic tobacco plants. Moreover, the OsBIERF3-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants also showed increased tolerance to salt stress. Our results suggest that OsBIERF3 may play important roles in disease resistance response and salt tolerance.
Plant Physiol.-2009-Oh-1368-79.pdf	Overexpression of the Transcription Factor AP37 in Rice Improves Grain Yield under Drought Conditions	2009	Plant Physiol	School of Biotechnology and Environmental Engineering, Myongji University, Yongin 449-728, Korea.	Transcription factors with an APETELA2 (AP2) domain have been implicated in various cellular processes involved in plant development and stress responses. Of the 139 AP2 genes predicted in rice (Oryza sativa), we identified 42 genes in our current study that are induced by one or more stress conditions, including drought, high salinity, low temperature, and abscisic acid. Phylogenic analysis of these 42 stress-inducible AP2 genes revealed the presence of six subgroups (I-VI) with distinct signature motifs. Two genes, AP37 and AP59, representing subgroups I and II, respectively, were functionally characterized. Both genes were found to be induced upon 2 h of exposure to drought and high-salinity conditions but to differ in their expression profile upon exposure to low temperature and abscisic acid. The overexpression of AP37 and AP59 in rice under the control of the constitutive promoter OsCc1 increased the tolerance to drought and high salinity at the vegetative stage. Increased tolerance to low temperatures was observed only in OsCc1:AP37 plants. More importantly, the OsCc1:AP37 plants showed significantly enhanced drought tolerance in the field, which increased grain yield by 16% to 57% over controls under severe drought conditions, yet exhibited no significant difference under normal growth conditions. In contrast, grain yield in OsCc1:AP59 plants in the field was reduced by 23% to 43% compared with controls under both normal and drought stress conditions. Microarray experiments identified 10 and 38 genes that are up-regulated by AP37 and AP59, respectively, in addition to 37 genes that are commonly induced by both factors. Our results suggest that the AP37 gene has the potential to improve drought tolerance in rice without causing undesirable growth phenotypes.
NA	Mutation of OsGIGANTEA Leads to Enhanced Tolerance to Polyethylene Glycol-Generated Osmotic Stress in Rice.	2016	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang UniversityHangzhou, China; College of Life Sciences, Qingdao Agricultural UniversityQingdao, China.	Water deficit is one of the most important environmental stresses limiting plant growth and crop yield. While the identification of many key factors involved in the plant water deficit response has greatly increased our knowledge about the regulation system, the mechanisms underlying dehydration tolerance in plants are still not well understood. In our current study, we investigated the roles of the key flowering time regulator, OsGIGANTEA (OsGI), in the osmotic stress tolerance in rice. Results showed that mutation of OsGI conferred tolerance to osmotic stress generated by polyethylene glycol (PEG), increased proline and sucrose contents, and accelerated stomata movement. In addition, qRT-PCR and microarray analysis revealed that the transcript abundance of some osmotic stress response genes, such as OsDREB1E, OsAP37, OsAP59, OsLIP9, OsLEA3, OsRAB16A, and OsSalT, was significantly higher in osgi than in WT plants, suggesting that OsGI might be a negative regulator in the osmotic stress response in rice.
NA	ERF Transcription Factor OsBIERF3 Positively Contributes to Immunity against Fungal and Bacterial Diseases but Negatively Regulates Cold Tolerance in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	We previously showed that overexpression of the rice ERF transcription factor gene OsBIERF3 in tobacco increased resistance against different pathogens. Here, we report the function of OsBIERF3 in rice immunity and abiotic stress tolerance. Expression of OsBIERF3 was induced by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, hormones (e.g., salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and abscisic acid), and abiotic stress (e.g., drought, salt and cold stress). OsBIERF3 has transcriptional activation activity that depends on its C-terminal region. The OsBIERF3-overexpressing (OsBIERF3-OE) plants exhibited increased resistance while OsBIERF3-suppressed (OsBIERF3-Ri) plants displayed decreased resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and X. oryzae pv. oryzae. A set of genes including those for PRs and MAPK kinases were up-regulated in OsBIERF3-OE plants. Cell wall biosynthetic enzyme genes were up-regulated in OsBIERF3-OE plants but down-regulated in OsBIERF3-Ri plants; accordingly, cell walls became thicker in OsBIERF3-OE plants but thinner in OsBIERF3-Ri plants than WT plants. The OsBIERF3-OE plants attenuated while OsBIERF3-Ri plants enhanced cold tolerance, accompanied by altered expression of cold-responsive genes and proline accumulation. Exogenous abscisic acid and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, a precursor of ethylene biosynthesis, restored the attenuated cold tolerance in OsBIERF3-OE plants while exogenous AgNO(3), an inhibitor of ethylene action, significantly suppressed the enhanced cold tolerance in OsBIERF3-Ri plants. These data demonstrate that OsBIERF3 positively contributes to immunity against M. oryzae and X. oryzae pv. oryzae but negatively regulates cold stress tolerance in rice.
