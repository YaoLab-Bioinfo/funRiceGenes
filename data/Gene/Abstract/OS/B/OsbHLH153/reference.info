NA	Genome-wide association studies reveal that members of bHLH subfamily 16 share a conserved function in regulating flag leaf angle in rice (Oryza sativa).	2018	PLoS Genet	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	As a major component of ideal plant architecture, leaf angle especially flag leaf angle (FLA) makes a large contribution to grain yield in rice. We utilized a worldwide germplasm collection to elucidate the genetic basis of FLA that would be helpful for molecular design breeding in rice. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a total of 40 and 32 QTLs for FLA in Wuhan and Hainan, respectively. Eight QTLs were commonly detected in both conditions. Of these, 2 and 3 QTLs were identified in the indica and japonica subpopulations, respectively. In addition, the candidates of 5 FLA QTLs were verified by haplotype-level association analysis. These results indicate diverse genetic bases for FLA between the indica and japonica subpopulations. Three candidates, OsbHLH153, OsbHLH173 and OsbHLH174, quickly responded to BR and IAA involved in plant architecture except for OsbHLH173, whose expression level was too low to be detected; their overexpression in plants increased rice leaf angle. Together with previous studies, it was concluded that all 6 members in bHLH subfamily 16 had the conserved function in regulating FLA in rice. A comparison with our previous GWAS for tiller angle (TA) showed only one QTL had pleiotropic effects on FLA and TA, which explained low similarity of the genetic basis between FLA and TA. An ideal plant architecture is expected to be efficiently developed by combining favorable alleles for FLA from indica with favorable alleles for TA from japonica by inter-subspecies hybridization.
