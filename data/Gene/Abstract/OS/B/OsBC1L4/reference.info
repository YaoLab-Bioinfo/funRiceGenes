Plant morphogenesis is highly dependent on the regulation of cell division and expansion. The organization of the cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall is a key determinant of cell expansion. Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 (Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library. It is reported here that OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that exhibits typical structural features of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor protein. The T-DNA insertion in OsBC1L4 results in abnormal cell expansion. A decrease in cellulose content but the increase in pectin and starch contents was identified in Osbc1l4 mutants by measuring the content of wall components. OsBC1L4 was expressed in all tissues/organs examined, with a low level in leaves. OsBC1L4 protein is mainly located in the cell wall and plasma membrane. Correlation analysis indicated that the expression of OsBC1L4 was highly correlated to that of several primary wall-forming cellulose synthase genes (CESAs). Moreover, the expression level of several cellulose-related genes is increased in Osbc1l4 mutants, which suggests that a feedback mechanism may exist during cellulose synthesis.
