OsBGal2	seedling	Molecular characterization of Î²-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15â€<U+393C><U+3E33>30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
OsBGal2	root	Molecular characterization of Î²-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15â€<U+393C><U+3E33>30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
OsBGal2	panicle	Molecular characterization of Î²-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The genes encoding two isoforms of Î²-galactosidase expressed in germinating rice and panicle, designated OsBGal1 and OsBGal2, were cloned and sequenced| The related OsBGal2 clone from panicle at flowering stage encodes 715 amino acid residues, including a signal peptide of 20 residues
OsBGal2	shoot	Molecular characterization of Î²-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15â€<U+393C><U+3E33>30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
OsBGal2	sheath	Molecular characterization of Î²-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15â€<U+393C><U+3E33>30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
OsBGal2	leaf	Molecular characterization of Î²-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15â€<U+393C><U+3E33>30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
OsBGal2	flower	Molecular characterization of Î²-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)	 The related OsBGal2 clone from panicle at flowering stage encodes 715 amino acid residues, including a signal peptide of 20 residues| Both were also expressed at low levels in flowers and immature seeds, but only the OsBGal2 transcript was found in mature seeds
