NA	OsbZIP48, a HY5 transcription factor ortholog, exerts pleiotropic effects in light-regulated development.	2017	Plant Physiol	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus CITY: New Delhi STATE: Delhi POSTAL_CODE: 110021 India [IN].	Plants have evolved an intricate network of sensory photoreceptors and signalling components to regulate their development. Among the light signalling components identified till date, HY5, a bZIP transcription factor, has been investigated extensively. However, most of the work on HY5 has been carried out in Arabidopsis, a dicot. In this study, based on homology search and phylogenetic analysis, we could identify three homologs of AtHY5 in monocots; however, AtHYH (HY5 homolog) homologs are absent in monocots analysed. Out of the three homologs identified in rice, we have functionally characterized OsbZIP48. OsbZIP48 was able to complement Athy5 mutant. OsbZIP48 protein levels are developmentally regulated in rice. Moreover, OsbZIP48 protein does not degrade in dark grown rice and Athy5 seedlings complemented with OsbZIP48, which is in striking contrast to AtHY5. In comparison to AtHY5, which does not cause any change in hypocotyl length when over-expressed in Arabidopsis, the over-expression of full-length OsbZIP48 in rice transgenics reduced the plant height considerably. Microarray analysis revealed that OsKO2, which encodes ent-kaurene oxidase 2 of GA biosynthesis pathway, is down-regulated in OsbZIP48OE and up-regulated in OsbZIP48KD transgenics as compared to the wild type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsbZIP48 directly binds to the OsKO2 promoter. The RNAi lines and T-DNA insertional mutant of OsbZIP48 showed seedling lethal phenotype despite the fact that roots were more proliferative during early stages of development. These data provide credible evidences that OsbZIP48 performs more diverse functions in a monocot system like rice in comparison to its Arabidopsis ortholog, HY5.
NA	Rice F-bZIP transcription factors regulate the zinc deficiency response 	2020	J Exp Bot	Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Copenhagen Plant Science Centre, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg-C, Denmark.	The F-bZIP transcription factors bZIP19 and bZIP23 are the central regulators of the zinc deficiency response in Arabidopsis, and phylogenetic analysis of F-bZIP homologs across land plants indicates that the regulatory mechanism of the zinc deficiency response may be conserved. Here, we identified the rice F-bZIP homologs and investigated their function. OsbZIP48 and OsbZIP50, but not OsbZIP49, complement the zinc deficiency-hypersensitive Arabidopsis bzip19bzip23 double mutant. Ectopic expression of OsbZIP50 in Arabidopsis significantly increases plant zinc accumulation under control zinc supply, suggesting an altered Zn sensing in OsbZIP50. In addition, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of F-bZIP homologs from representative monocot species that supports the branching of plant F-bZIPs into Group 1 and Group 2. Our results suggest that regulation of the zinc deficiency response in rice is conserved, with OsbZIP48 being a functional homolog of AtbZIP19 and AtbZIP23. A better understanding of the mechanisms behind the Zn deficiency response in rice and other important crops will contribute to develop plant-based strategies to address the problems of Zn deficiency in soils, crops, and cereal-based human diets. 
NA	Comparative transcriptome profile analysis of rice varieties with different tolerance to zinc deficiency	2020	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	CAAS-IRRI Joint Laboratory for Genomics-Assisted Germplasm Enhancement, Agricultural Genomics Institute in Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shenzhen, China.	Zinc (Zn) is an indispensable element for rice growth. Zn deficiency results in brown blotches and streaks 2-3 weeks after transplanting, as well as stunting, reduced tillering, and low productivity of rice plants. These processes are controlled by different families of expressed genes. A comparative transcriptome profile analysis was conducted using the roots of two Zn deficiency tolerant varieties (UCP122 and KALIBORO26) and two sensitive varieties (IR26 and IR64) by merging data from untreated control (CK) and Zn deficiency treated samples. Results revealed a total of 4,688 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the normal Zn and deficient conditions, with 2,702 and 1,489 unique DEGs upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified transcription factors (TFs), such as WRKY, MYB, ERF, and bHLH which are important in the regulation of the Zn deficiency response. Furthermore, chitinases, jasmonic acid, and phenylpropanoid pathways were found to be important in the Zn deficiency response. The metal tolerance protein (MTP) genes also appeared to play an important role in conferring tolerance to Zn deficiency. A heavy metal-associated domain-containing protein 7 was associated with tolerance to Zn deficiency and negatively regulated downstream genes. Collectively, our findings provide valuable expression patterns and candidate genes for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the response to Zn deficiency and for improvements in breeding for tolerance to Zn deficiency in rice.
