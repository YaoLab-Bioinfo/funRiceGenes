Subgroup IVc basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 positively regulate major iron deficiency responses in rice in a similar but distinct manner, putatively under partial control by OsHRZs. Under low iron availability, plants transcriptionally induce the expression of genes involved in iron uptake and translocation. OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 ubiquitin ligases negatively regulate this iron deficiency response in rice. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor OsbHLH060 interacts with OsHRZ1, and positively regulates iron deficiency-inducible genes. However, the functions of three other subgroup IVc bHLH transcription factors in rice, OsbHLH057, OsbHLH058, and OsbHLH059, have not yet been characterized. In the present study, we investigated the functions of OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 related to iron deficiency response. OsbHLH058 expression was repressed under iron deficiency, whereas the expression of OsbHLH057 and OsbHLH060 was moderately induced. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OsbHLH058 interacts with OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 more strongly than OsbHLH060, whereas OsbHLH059 showed no interaction. An in vitro ubiquitination assay detected no OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH060 ubiquitination by OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing OsbHLH058 showed tolerance for iron deficiency and higher iron concentration in seeds. These lines also showed enhanced expression of many iron deficiency-inducible genes involved in iron uptake and translocation under iron-sufficient conditions. Conversely, OsbHLH058 knockdown lines showed susceptibility to iron deficiency and reduced expression of many iron deficiency-inducible genes. OsbHLH059 knockdown lines were also susceptible to iron deficiency, and formed characteristic brownish regions in iron-deficient new leaves. OsbHLH059 knockdown lines also showed reduced expression of many iron deficiency-inducible genes. These results indicate that OsbHLH058 and OsbHLH059 positively regulate major iron deficiency responses in a similar but distinct manner, and that this function may be partially controlled by OsHRZs.
