OsKOS1|OsKOL4|CYP701A8|qST-6.2	OsKOS2|OsKOL5	A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu (D35), encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase	Expression analysis revealed that OsKOL2 and OsKOL4 were actively transcribed in various organs, while OsKOL1 and OsKOL5 were expressed only at low levels; OsKOL3 may be a pseudogene
OsKOS1|OsKOL4|CYP701A8|qST-6.2	OsKOS2|OsKOL5	A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu (D35), encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase	OsKOL4 and OsKOL5 are likely to take part in phytoalexin biosynthesis, because their expression was promoted by UV irradiation and/or elicitor treatment
D35|OsKOS3|OsKO2	OsKOS1|OsKOL4|CYP701A8|qST-6.2	CYP701A8: a rice ent-kaurene oxidase paralog diverted to more specialized diterpenoid metabolism	In particular, under conditions where OsKO2 catalyzes the expected conversion of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid required for GA biosynthesis, OsKOL4 instead efficiently reacts with ent-sandaracopimaradiene and ent-cassadiene to produce the corresponding C3alpha-hydroxylated diterpenoids
