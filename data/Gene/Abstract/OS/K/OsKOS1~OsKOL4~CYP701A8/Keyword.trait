OsKOS1|OsKOL4|CYP701A8	dwarf	A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu (D35), encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase	Introduction of OsKOL4 into d35Tan-Ginbozu did not rescue its dwarf phenotype, indicating that OsKOL4 is not involved in GA biosynthesis
OsKOS1|OsKOL4|CYP701A8	 ga 	A rice semi-dwarf gene, Tan-Ginbozu (D35), encodes the gibberellin biosynthesis enzyme, ent-kaurene oxidase	Introduction of OsKOL4 into d35Tan-Ginbozu did not rescue its dwarf phenotype, indicating that OsKOL4 is not involved in GA biosynthesis
OsKOS1|OsKOL4|CYP701A8	 ga 	CYP701A8: a rice ent-kaurene oxidase paralog diverted to more specialized diterpenoid metabolism	In particular, under conditions where OsKO2 catalyzes the expected conversion of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid required for GA biosynthesis, OsKOL4 instead efficiently reacts with ent-sandaracopimaradiene and ent-cassadiene to produce the corresponding C3alpha-hydroxylated diterpenoids
OsKOS1|OsKOL4|CYP701A8	 ga 	CYP701A8: a rice ent-kaurene oxidase paralog diverted to more specialized diterpenoid metabolism	Thus, it appears that OsKOL4 plays a role in the more specialized diterpenoid metabolism of rice, and our results provide evidence for divergence of a KO/CYP701 family member from GA biosynthesis
OsKOS1|OsKOL4|CYP701A8	gibberellin	Assessment of efficacy of mutagenesis of gamma-irradiation in plant height and days to maturity through expression analysis in rice	 Gibberellin responsiveness study and quantitative real-time PCR showed a faulty gibberellin pathway and epistatic control between the genes such as OsKOL4 and OsBRD2 causing semi-dwarfism in a mutant
