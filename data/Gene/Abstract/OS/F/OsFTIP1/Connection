OsFTIP1	OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a|RFT1	OsFTIP1-Mediated Regulation of Florigen Transport in Rice Is Negatively Regulated by a Ubiquitin-like Domain Kinase OsUbDKÎ³4.	 Here we show that rice FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (OsFTIP1), a member of the family of multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) and the closest ortholog of Arabidopsis FTIP1, is required for export of RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) from companion cells to sieve elements
OsFTIP1	OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a|RFT1	OsFTIP1-Mediated Regulation of Florigen Transport in Rice Is Negatively Regulated by a Ubiquitin-like Domain Kinase OsUbDKÎ³4.	 We further reveal that a ubiquitin-like domain kinase Î³4, OsUbDKÎ³4, interacts with OsFTIP1, and modulates its degradation in leaves through the 26S proteasome, which in turn affects RFT1 transport to the SAM
OsFTIP1	OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a|RFT1	OsFTIP1-Mediated Regulation of Florigen Transport in Rice Is Negatively Regulated by a Ubiquitin-like Domain Kinase OsUbDKÎ³4.	 Thus, dynamic modulation of OsFTIP1 abundance in leaves by a negative regulator OsUbDKÎ³4 is integral to the role of OsFTIP1 in mediating RFT1 transport in rice, and provide key evidence for a conserved role of FTIP1-like MCTPs in mediating florigen transport in flowering plants

OsFTIP1	OsMFT1	Nuclear Translocation of OsMFT1 That is Impeded by OsFTIP1 Promotes Drought Tolerance in Rice	 Further study reveals that OsFTIP1 interacts with a PEBP, rice MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (OsMFT1), which promotes rice tolerance to drought treatment
OsFTIP1	OsMFT1	Nuclear Translocation of OsMFT1 That is Impeded by OsFTIP1 Promotes Drought Tolerance in Rice	 We further revealed that OsFTIP1 impedes the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of OsMFT1
OsFTIP1	OsMFT1	Nuclear Translocation of OsMFT1 That is Impeded by OsFTIP1 Promotes Drought Tolerance in Rice	 These results demonstrate that dynamic modulation of drought responsive genes by OsMFT1-OsMYB26 complex and OsMFT1-OsbZIP66 complex is integral to OsFTIP1 effect on impeding nuclear translocation of OsMFT1
OsFTIP1	OsFTIP9	The tetratricopeptide repeat protein OsTPR075 promotes heading by regulating florigen transport in rice.	 Furthermore, we show that the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein OsTPR075 interacts with both OsFTIP9 and OsFTIP1 and strengthens their respective interactions with Hd3a and the florigen RFT1
