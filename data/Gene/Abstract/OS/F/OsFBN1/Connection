OsAOS2	OsFBN1	Overexpressing OsFBN1 enhances plastoglobule formation, reduces grain-filling percent and jasmonate levels under heat stress in rice.	 Moreover, overexpressing OsFBN1 affected the transcription levels of OsAOS2 in JA synthesis, OsTHF1, OsABC1K7 and OsPsaE in thylakoid stability and photosynthesis, OsABC1-4 and OsSPS2 in ubiquinone-metabolism, OsHDR, OsDXR, and OsFPPS in isoprenoid metabolism
OsDXR	OsFBN1	Overexpressing OsFBN1 enhances plastoglobule formation, reduces grain-filling percent and jasmonate levels under heat stress in rice.	 Moreover, overexpressing OsFBN1 affected the transcription levels of OsAOS2 in JA synthesis, OsTHF1, OsABC1K7 and OsPsaE in thylakoid stability and photosynthesis, OsABC1-4 and OsSPS2 in ubiquinone-metabolism, OsHDR, OsDXR, and OsFPPS in isoprenoid metabolism
OsFBN1	OsHDR|OsHMBPP	Overexpressing OsFBN1 enhances plastoglobule formation, reduces grain-filling percent and jasmonate levels under heat stress in rice.	 Moreover, overexpressing OsFBN1 affected the transcription levels of OsAOS2 in JA synthesis, OsTHF1, OsABC1K7 and OsPsaE in thylakoid stability and photosynthesis, OsABC1-4 and OsSPS2 in ubiquinone-metabolism, OsHDR, OsDXR, and OsFPPS in isoprenoid metabolism
