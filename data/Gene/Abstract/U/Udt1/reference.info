Tapetum development and meiosis play crucial roles in anther development. Here we identified a rice gene, DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1), which controls the early stages of that development. This gene encodes for an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that is present only in cereals. Our T-DNA insertion mutations gave rise to abnormal tapetal formation. Cellular organelles, especially the ER, were underdeveloped, which led to hampered differentiation and degeneration of the tapetum. In addition, the development of pollen mother cells was arrested at the early stages of meiotic prophase I. RNA in-situ hybridization analyses showed that DTM1 transcripts were most abundant in tapetal cells at stages 6 and 7, and moderately in the pollen mother cells and meiocytes. Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis. However, expression of MSP1 and MEL1, which function in anther wall specification and germ cell division, respectively, was not altered in the dtm1 mutant. Moreover, transcripts of DTM1 were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in udt1 and pair1 mutants. These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1.

In higher plants, male reproductive development is a complex biological process that includes cell division and differentiation, cell to cell communication etc., while the mechanism underlying plant male reproductive development remains less understood. GAMYB encodes a gibberellins acid (GA) inducible transcription factor that is required for the early anther development in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a new allele gamyb-4 with a C base deletion in the second exon (+2308), causing a frame shift and premature translational termination. Histological analysis showed that gamyb-4 developed abnormal enlarged tapetum and could not undergo normal meiosis. To understand the regulatory role of GAMYB, we carried out quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and comparison of microarray data. These results revealed that the expression of TDR (TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION), a tapetal cell death regulator, was downregulated in gamyb-4 and udt1 (undeveloped tapetum1). While the GAMYB expression was not obviously changed in tdr and udt1-1, and no apparent expression fold change of UDT1 in tdr and gamyb-4, suggesting that TDR may act downstream of GAMYB and UDT1, and GAMYB and UDT1 work in parallel to regulate rice early anther development. This work is helpful in understanding the regulatory network in rice anther development.
tpc1702705.pdf	Rice Undeveloped Tapetum1 is a major regulator of early tapetum development	2005	Plant Cell	National Research Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics, Division of Molecular and Life Sciences, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang 790-784, Republic of Korea. jkhim@postech.ac.kr	The tapetum, the innermost of four sporophytic layers in the anther wall, comes in direct contact with the developing male gametophyte and is thought to play a crucial role in the development and maturation of microspores. Here, we report the identification of rice (Oryza sativa) Undeveloped Tapetum1 (Udt1), which is required for the differentiation of secondary parietal cells to mature tapetal cells. T-DNA or retrotransposon Tos17 insertions in the Udt1 gene caused male sterility. The anther walls and meiocytes of the mutants were normal during the early premeiosis stage, but their tapeta failed to differentiate and became vacuolated during the meiotic stage. In addition, meiocytes did not develop to microspores, and middle layer degeneration was inhibited. Consequently, the anther locules contained no pollen. The UDT1:green fluorescent protein fusion protein was localized to the nucleus. This, together with its homology with other basic helix-loop-helix proteins, suggests that UDT1 is a transcription factor. DNA microarray analysis identified 958 downregulated and 267 upregulated genes in the udt1-1 anthers, suggesting that Udt1 plays a major role in maintaining tapetum development, starting in early meiosis.
NA	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, 100 Guilin Road, Shanghai, 200234, China.	Background: During anther development, the tapetum provides essential nutrients and materials for pollen development. In rice, multiple transcription factors and enzymes essential for tapetum development and pollen wall formation have been cloned from male-sterile lines.  Results: In this study, we obtained several lines in which the MYB transcription factor OsMS188 was knocked out through the CRISPR-Cas9 approach. The osms188 lines exhibited a male-sterile phenotype with aberrant development and degeneration of tapetal cells, absence of the sexine layer and defective anther cuticles. CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice. Plants with mutations in these genes are male sterile, with a defective sexine layer and anther cuticle. Further biochemical assays demonstrated that OsMS188 binds directly to the promoters of these genes to regulate their expression. UDT1, OsTDF1, TDR, bHLH142 and EAT1 are upstream regulators of rice tapetum development. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and activation assays revealed that TDR directly regulates OsMS188 expression. Additionally, protein interaction assays indicated that TDR interacts with OsMS188 to regulate downstream gene expression.  Conclusion: Overall, OsMS188 is a key regulator of tapetum development and pollen wall formation. The gene regulatory network established in this work may facilitate future investigations of fertility regulation in rice and in other crop species.
