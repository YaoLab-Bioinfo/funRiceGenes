GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	GS3	The additive effects of GS3 and qGL3 on rice grain length regulation revealed by genetic and transcriptome comparisons.	To investigate the genetic interaction between two major grain length loci of rice, GS3 and qGL3, we developed two near-isogenic lines (NILs), NIL-GS3 (GS3/qGL3) and NIL-qgl3 (gs3/qgl3), in the genetic background of 93-11 (gs3/qGL3) by conventional backcrossing and marker-assisted selection (MAS)
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	GS3	The additive effects of GS3 and qGL3 on rice grain length regulation revealed by genetic and transcriptome comparisons.	By comparing the grain lengths of 93-11, NIL-GS3, NIL-qgl3 and NIL-GS3/qgl3, we investigated the effects of GS3, qGL3 and GS3 × qGL3 interaction on grain length based on two-way ANOVA
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	GS3	The additive effects of GS3 and qGL3 on rice grain length regulation revealed by genetic and transcriptome comparisons.	We found that GS3 and qGL3 had additive effects on rice grain length regulation
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	GS3	The additive effects of GS3 and qGL3 on rice grain length regulation revealed by genetic and transcriptome comparisons.	Comparative analysis of primary panicle transcriptomes in the four NILs revealed that the genes affected by GS3 and qGL3 partially overlapped, and both loci might be involved in brassinosteroid signaling
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	OsGSK3	Rice qGL3/OsPPKL1 Functions with the GSK3/SHAGGY-Like Kinase OsGSK3 to Modulate Brassinosteroid Signaling.	 Unlike the dephosphorylation of BIN2 (which leads to protein degradation) in Arabidopsis, qGL3 dephosphorylates and stabilizes OsGSK3 in rice
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	OsGSK3	Rice qGL3/OsPPKL1 Functions with the GSK3/SHAGGY-Like Kinase OsGSK3 to Modulate Brassinosteroid Signaling.	 These results demonstrate that qGL3 suppresses BR signaling by regulating the phosphorylation and stability of OsGSK3, which modulates OsBZR1 phosphorylation and subcellular distribution
