BACKGROUND: Plant protoplasts, a proven physiological and versatile cell system, are widely used in high-throughput analysis and functional characterization of genes. Green protoplasts have been successfully used in investigations of plant signal transduction pathways related to hormones, metabolites and environmental challenges. In rice, protoplasts are commonly prepared from suspension cultured cells or etiolated seedlings, but only a few studies have explored the use of protoplasts from rice green tissue. RESULTS: Here, we report a simplified method for isolating protoplasts from normally cultivated young rice green tissue without the need for unnecessary chemicals and a vacuum device. Transfections of the generated protoplasts with plasmids of a wide range of sizes (4.5-13 kb) and co-transfections with multiple plasmids achieved impressively high efficiencies and allowed evaluations by 1) protein immunoblotting analysis, 2) subcellular localization assays, and 3) protein-protein interaction analysis by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and firefly luciferase complementation (FLC). Importantly, the rice green tissue protoplasts were photosynthetically active and sensitive to the retrograde plastid signaling inducer norflurazon (NF). Transient expression of the GFP-tagged light-related transcription factor OsGLK1 markedly upregulated transcript levels of the endogeneous photosynthetic genes OsLhcb1, OsLhcp, GADPH and RbcS, which were reduced to some extent by NF treatment in the rice green tissue protoplasts. CONCLUSIONS: We show here a simplified and highly efficient transient gene expression system using photosynthetically active rice green tissue protoplasts and its broad applications in protein immunoblot, localization and protein-protein interaction assays. These rice green tissue protoplasts will be particularly useful in studies of light/chloroplast-related processes.
NA	Proteomic Analysis of Rice Subjected to Low Light Stress and Overexpression of OsGAPB Increases the Stress Tolerance.	2020	Rice	Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, 610041, China.	BACKGROUND: Light provides the energy for photosynthesis and determines plant morphogenesis and development. Low light compromises photosynthetic efficiency and leads to crop yield loss. It remains unknown how rice responds to low light stress at a proteomic level.  RESULTS: In this study, the quantitative proteomic analysis with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) was used and 1221 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified from wild type rice plants grown in control or low light condition (17% light intensity of control), respectively. Bioinformatic analysis of DEPs indicated low light remarkably affects the abundance of chloroplastic proteins. Specifically, the proteins involved in carbon fixation (Calvin cycle), electron transport, and ATPase complex are severely downregulated under low light. Furthermore, overexpression of the downregulated gene encoding rice ¦Â subunit of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (OsGAPB), an enzyme in Calvin cycle, significantly increased the CO2 assimilation rate, chlorophyll content and fresh weight under low light conditions but have no obvious effect on rice growth and development under control light.  CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that low light stress on vegetative stage of rice inhibits photosynthesis possibly by decreasing the photosynthetic proteins and OsGAPB gene is a good candidate for manipulating rice tolerance to low light stress.
