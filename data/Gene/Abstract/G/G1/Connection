G1	OsCDC48	OsCDC48/48E complex is required for plant survival in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Removal of the C-terminus of OsCDC48 caused altered expression of cell cycle-related genes, changed the percentage of cells in G1 and G2/M phases, and abolished the interaction between OsCDC48 itself and between OsCDC48 and OsCDC48E, respectively
