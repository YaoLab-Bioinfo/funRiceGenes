60_568.pdf	Gene-gene interactions between mutants that accumulate abnormally high amounts of proglutelin in rice seed	2010	Breeding Science	Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University	We had previously identified eight mutants, esp2 and g(G)lups1 to 7, which accumulated abnormally high amounts of proglutelin, the major storage protein in rice seeds. Analysis of their seed proteins by SDS-PAGE, their levels of the luminal chaperone BiP and gene-gene interactions indicated that these mutants fell into four classes. The most epistatic class consisted of esp2, which encodes a defective protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). A second class consisting of Glup1, glup2 and glup7 was hypostatic to esp2, and showed abnormally high levels of BiP, suggesting that maturation and export of proglutelins from the ER are inhibited in this class of mutants. The third class containing glup4, Glup5 and glup6 mutations was hypostatic to esp2, Glup1, glup2 and glup7. Since the glup4 allele encodes the small GTPase Rab5a, which participates in the trafficking of proglutelin from Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole (PSV), this third class of mutants is likely affected in this process. Lastly, glup3, which encodes a vacuolar processing enzyme, which proteolytically processes proglutelin into acidic and basic subunits within the PSV, was hypostatic to the other mutants. Overall, these gene relationships are consistent with the sequential intracellular transport and processing of proglutelin and provide novel insights on the trafficking of proglutelin to the PSV.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) accumulates prolamines and glutelins as its major storage proteins. Glutelins are synthesized on rough endoplasmic reticulum as 57-kDa precursors; they are then sorted into protein storage vacuoles where they are processed into acidic and basic subunits. We report a novel rice glutelin mutant, W379, which accumulates higher levels of the 57-kDa glutelin precursor. Genetic analysis revealed that the W379 phenotype is controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we identified this gene, OsVPE1, which is a homolog of the Arabidopsis betaVPE gene. OsVPE1 encodes a 497-amino-acid polypeptide. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation in W379 that changes Cys269 to Gly. Like the wild-type protein, the mutant protein is sorted into vacuoles; however, the enzymatic activity of the mutant OsVPE1 is almost completely eliminated. Further, we show that OsVPE1 is incorrectly cleaved, resulting in a mature protein that is smaller than the wild-type mature protein. Taken together, these results demonstrate that OsVPE1 is a cysteine protease that plays a crucial role in the maturation of rice glutelins. Further, OsVPE1 Cys269 is a key residue for maintaining the Asn-specific cleavage activity of OsVPE1.

Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is known to be a key player in apoptosis in animals. The components and pathways regulating H(2)O(2)-induced programmed cell death in plants, however, remain largely unknown. In the present study, rice transgenic lines overexpressing Bcl-2, a human apoptotic suppressor, were obtained. These transgenic lines showed increased tolerance to high levels of H(2)O(2), resulting in increased seed germination rates, root elongation, root tip cell viability and chlorophyll retention compared to control lines. In the control lines, treatment with H(2)O(2) resulted in DNA laddering and a clear terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling signal, which are the hallmarks of programmed cell death. However, this effect was not detected in the Bcl-2-overexpressing transgenic lines. Further investigations indicated that Bcl-2 suppressed H(2)O(2)-induced programmed cell death but did not inhibit stress-elicited reactive oxygen species production in rice. RT-PCR revealed that the expression of the two vacuolar processing enzyme genes (i.e. OsVPE2 and OsVPE3) was dramatically induced by H(2)O(2) in the wild-type line but not in the Bcl-2-overexpressing line. Moreover, treatment with H(2)O(2) resulted in the disruption of the vacuolar membrane in the wild-type line. The expression levels of OsVPE1 and OsVPE4 did not significantly differ between the wild-type line and the transgenic line that was treated or untreated with H(2)O(2). The similar roles of Bcl-2 and OsVPEs during endogenous reactive oxygen species-triggered programmed cell death were also confirmed by NaCl stress in rice. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonsatrate that Bcl-2 overexpression inhibits H(2)O(2)-induced programmed cell death and enhances H(2)O(2) tolerance. We propose that Bcl-2 overexpression in rice suppresses the transcriptional activation of OsVPE2 and OsVPE3, but not of OsVPE1 or OsVPE4.
Plant Cell Physiol-2010-Kumamaru-38-46.pdf	Vacuolar processing enzyme plays an essential role in the crystalline structure of glutelin in rice seed	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. kumamaru@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp	To identify the function of genes that regulate the processing of proglutelin, we performed an analysis of glup3 mutants, which accumulates excess amounts of proglutelin and lack the vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE). VPE activity in developing seeds from glup3 lines was reduced remarkably compared with the wild type. DNA sequencing of the VPE gene in glup3 mutants revealed either amino acid substitutions or the appearance of a stop codon within the coding region. Microscopic observations showed that alpha-globulin and proglutelin were distributed homogeneously within glup3 protein storage vacuoles (PSVs), and that glup3 PSVs lacked the crystalline lattice structure typical of wild-type PSVs. This suggests that the processing of proglutelin by VPE in rice is essential for proper PSV structure and compartmentalization of storage proteins. Growth retardation in glup3 seedlings was also observed, indicating that the processing of proglutelin influences early seedling development. These findings indicate that storage of glutelin in its mature form as a crystalline structure in PSVs is required for the rapid use of glutelin as a source of amino acids during early seedling development. In conclusion, VPE plays an important role in the formation of protein crystalline structures in PSVs.
NA	Identification of vacuolar phosphate efflux transporters in land plants.	2019	Nat Plants	Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilizers, Ministry of Agriculture, Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is an essential component of all life forms. Land plants acquire Pi from the soil through roots and associated symbioses, and it is then transported throughout the plant. When sufficient, excess Pi is stored in vacuoles for remobilization following Pi deficiency. Although Pi release from the vacuoles to the cytoplasm serves as a critical mechanism for plants to adapt to low-Pi stress, the transporters responsible for vacuolar Pi efflux have not been identified. Here, we identified a pair of Oryza sativa vacuolar Pi efflux transporters (OsVPE1 and OsVPE2) that were more abundant in plants grown under Pi-deficient conditions. These OsVPE proteins can transport Pi into yeast cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes. Vacuolar Pi content was higher in the loss-of-function Osvpe1<U+2009>Osvpe2 double mutant than in wild type, particularly under low-Pi stress. Overexpression of either OsVPE1 or OsVPE2 in transgenic plants reduced vacuolar Pi content, consistent with a role in vacuolar Pi efflux. We demonstrate that these VPE proteins evolved from an ancient plasma membrane glycerol-3-phosphate transporter protein. Together, these data indicate that this transporter was recruited to the vacuolar membrane to catalyse Pi efflux during the course of land plant evolution.
