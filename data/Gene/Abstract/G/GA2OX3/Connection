GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	OsMADS57	Rice transcription factor OsMADS57 regulates plant height by modulating gibberellin catabolism.	 Expectedly, the transcript levels of OsGA2ox3, encoding GAs deactivated enzyme, were significantly enhanced in OsMADS57 knockdown plants
GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	OsMADS57	Rice transcription factor OsMADS57 regulates plant height by modulating gibberellin catabolism.	 More importantly, dual-luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsMADS57 directly regulates the transcription of OsGA2ox3 as well as EUI1 through binding to the CArG-box motifs in their promoter regions
