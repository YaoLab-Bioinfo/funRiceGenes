Further, we find that haplotype combinations of DTH7 with Grain number, plant height, and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and DTH8 correlate well with the heading date and grain yield of rice under different photoperiod conditions
Ehd1	Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	Days to heading 7, a major quantitative locus determining photoperiod sensitivity and regional adaptation in rice.	We show that in long days DTH7 acts downstream of the photoreceptor phytochrome B to repress the expression of Ehd1, an up-regulator of the &quot;florigen&quot; genes (Hd3a and RFT1), leading to delayed flowering
Ghd7	Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	Days to heading 7, a major quantitative locus determining photoperiod sensitivity and regional adaptation in rice.	Further, we find that haplotype combinations of DTH7 with Grain number, plant height, and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and DTH8 correlate well with the heading date and grain yield of rice under different photoperiod conditions

Ghd7	Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	OsPRR37 and Ghd7 are the major genes for general combining ability of DTH, PH and SPP in rice.	OsPRR37 and Ghd7 are the major genes for general combining ability of DTH, PH and SPP in rice.
Ghd7	Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	OsPRR37 and Ghd7 are the major genes for general combining ability of DTH, PH and SPP in rice.	Both GCA1 and GCA2 were loss-of-function gene in low-GCA parent and gain-of-function gene in high-GCA parent, encoding the putative Pseudo-Response Regulators, OsPRR37 and Ghd7, respectively
Ghd7	Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	OsPRR37 and Ghd7 are the major genes for general combining ability of DTH, PH and SPP in rice.	Our results demonstrate that two GCA loci associate with OsPRR37 and Ghd7 and reveal that the genes responsible for important agronomic traits could simultaneously account for GCA effects
Ehd1	Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	OsPRR37 confers an expanded regulation of the diurnal rhythms of the transcriptome and photoperiodic flowering pathways in rice.	 Further study shows that OsPRR37 expands its regulation on flowering pathways by repressing Ehd1
