GTE4|OsGTE4	OsMAP	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice	Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
GTE4|OsGTE4	OsMAP	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice	Nevertheless some genes, FAS1/FSM, GTE4 and MAP, require CRL1 to be induced by auxin suggesting that they are likely directly regulated by CRL1
