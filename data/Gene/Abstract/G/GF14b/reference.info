Chen F-DNA Research 2006 .pdf	The rice 14-3-3 gene family and its involvement in responses to biotic and abiotic stress	2006	DNA Res	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, The Chinese Academy of Sciences 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China.	14-3-3 proteins function as major regulators of primary metabolism and cellular signal transduction in plants. However, their involvement in plant defense and stress responses is largely unknown. In order to better address functions of the rice 14-3-3/GF14 proteins in defense and abiotic stress responses, we examined the rice GF14 family that comprises eight numbers. The phylogenetic comparison with the Arabidopsis 14-3-3 family revealed that the majority of rice GF14s might have evolved as an independent branch. At least four rice GF14 genes, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and Gf14f were differentially regulated in the interactions of rice-Magnaporthe grisea and rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, and the incompatible interactions stronger induced the genes than the compatible interactions. These GF14 genes were also induced by the defense compounds, benzothiadiazole, methyl jasmonate, ethephon and hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, they were differentially regulated by salinity, drought, wounding and abscisic acid. Tissue-specific analysis and expression of GF14-YFP fusions revealed that the four GF14 isoforms were expressed with tissue specificity and accumulated differentially in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Our current study provides fundamental information for the further investigation of the rice GF14 proteins.
NA	OsGF14b Positively Regulates Panicle Blast Resistance, but Negatively Regulates Leaf Blast Resistance in Rice.	2015	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Rice Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China ; liuqing198504@126.com.	Although 14-3-3 proteins have been reported to be involved in responses to biotic stresses in plants, their functions in rice blast, the most destructive disease in rice, are largely unknown. Only GF14e has been confirmed to negatively regulate leaf blast. We report that GF14b is highly expressed in seedlings and panicles during blast infection. Rice plants overexpressing GF14b show enhanced resistance to panicle blast, but are susceptible to leaf blast. In contrast, GF14b silenced plants show increased susceptibility to panicle blast, but enhanced resistance to leaf blast. Yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that WRKY71 binds to the promoter of GF14b and modulates its expression. Overexpression of GF14b induces expression of jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis-related genes, but suppresses expression of salicylic acid (SA) synthesis-related genes. In contrast, suppressed GF14b expression causes decreased expression of JA synthesis-related genes, but activation of SA synthesis-related genes. These results suggest that GF14b positively regulates panicle blast resistance, but negatively regulates leaf blast resistance, and that GF14b mediated disease resistance is associated with the JA- and SA-dependent pathway. The different functions for 14-3-3 proteins in leaf and panicle blast provide new evidence that leaf and panicle blast resistance are controlled by different mechanisms.
NA	Involvement of OsGF14b Adaptation in the Drought Resistance of Rice Plants.	2019	Rice (N Y)	Center for Plant Water-use and Nutrition Regulation and College of Life Sciences, Joint International Research Laboratory of Water and Nutrient in Crop, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Jinshan, Fuzhou, 350002, China.	Drought stress is one of the major abiotic stresses that restrict plant growth and development. 14-3-3 proteins have been validated to regulate many biological processes in plants. Previous research demonstrated that OsGF14b plays different roles in panicle and leaf blast resistance. In this study, we researched the function of OsGF14b in drought resistance in rice.Here, we report that OsGF14b was strongly induced by soil drought stress. In comparison with wild type (WT), the osgf14b mutant exhibited improved resistance to drought and osmotic stress by changing the content of stress-relevant parameters, complementation of the osgf14b mutant restored the drought sensitivity to WT levels, whereas the OsGF14b-overexpression lines exhibited enhanced sensitivity to drought and osmotic stress. The osgf14b mutant plants were hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA), while the OsGF14b-overexpression plants showed reduced sensitivity to ABA. Furthermore, mutation and overexpression of OsGF14b affected the expression of stress-related genes under normal growth conditions and/or drought stress conditions.We have demonstrated that OsGF14b is involved in the drought resistance of rice plants, partially in an ABA-dependent manner.
