GS2|OsGRF4|GL2|GLW2|LGS1	GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses	Furthermore, we found that GSK2, the central negative regulator of rice brassinosteroid signalling, directly interacts with OsGRF4 and inhibits its transcription activation activity to mediate the specific regulation of grain length by the hormone.
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	GW5|qSW5	GW5 acts in the brassinosteroid signalling pathway to regulate grain width and weight in rice.	 GW5 protein is localized to the plasma membrane and can physically interact with and repress the kinase activity of rice GSK2 (glycogen synthase kinase 2), a homologue of Arabidopsis BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2) kinase, resulting in accumulation of unphosphorylated OsBZR1 (Oryza sativa BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1) and DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) proteins in the nucleus to mediate brassinosteroid (BR)-responsive gene expression and growth responses (including grain width and weight)
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OFP1	Brassinosteroids Regulate OFP1, a DLT Interacting Protein, to Modulate Plant Architecture and Grain Morphology in Rice.	 Furthermore, we revealed that OFP1 directly interacts with GSK2 kinase, and inhibition of the kinase activity significantly promotes OFP1 protein accumulation in plant
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsGAMYBL2	A brassinosteroid responsive miRNA-target module regulates gibberellin biosynthesis and plant development.	 Furthermore, OsGSK2, a key negative player in BR signaling, interacts with OsGAMYBL2 and prevents it from being degraded under 24-epibrassinolide treatment, whereas SLR1, a rice DELLA protein negatively regulating GA signaling, interacts with OsGAMYBL2 and prevents OsGAMYBL2 from binding to the target gene promoter
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsBZR1	OsBZR1 turnover mediated by OsSK22-regulated U-box E3 ligase OsPUB24 in rice BR response.	 Our findings suggest that OsPUB24 participates in OsBZR1 turnover and the regulatory networks of OsPUB24, OsSK22, and OsBZR1 are crucial for fine-tuning the BR response in rice
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Here, we identified OFP3 (OVATE FAMILY PROTEIN 3) as an interactor of both GSK2 and DLT by yeast two-hybrid screening and demonstrated that OFP3 plays a distinctly negative role in BR responses
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Moreover, treatment with either BR or bikinin, a GSK3-like kinase inhibitor, induced OFP3 depletion, whereas GSK2 or brassinazole, a BR synthesis inhibitor, promoted OFP3 accumulation
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Importantly, GSK2 can phosphorylate OFP3 and enhance these interactions
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 We propose that OFP3, as a suppressor of both BR synthesis and signaling but stabilized by GSK2, incorporates into a transcription factor complex to facilitate BR signaling control, which is critical for the proper development of various tissues
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	LARGE1|OML4	Control of Grain Size and Weight by the GSK2-LARGE1/OML4 Pathway in Rice.	 Here we report that the MEI2-LIKE PROTEIN 4 (OML4) encoded by the LARGE1 gene is phosphorylated by the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 2 (GSK2) and negatively controls grain size and weight in rice
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsMYC2	Rice stripe virus suppresses jasmonic acid-mediated resistance by hijacking brassinosteroid signaling pathway in rice	 OsGSK2 physically interacts with OsMYC2, resulting in the degradation of OsMYC2 by phosphorylation and reduces JA-mediated defense to facilitate virus infection
