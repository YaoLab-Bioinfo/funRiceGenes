In Arabidopsis thaliana, the GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2) plays a critical role in the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway by negatively regulating the activities of bri1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1/BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 family transcription factors that regulate the expression of downstream BR-responsive genes. In this study, we analyzed the function of a rice (Oryza sativa) GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase (GSK2), which is one of the orthologs of BIN2. Overexpression of GSK2 (Go) led to plants with typical BR loss-of-function phenotypes, and suppression of GSK2 resulted in enhanced BR signaling phenotypes. DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (DLT) is a positive regulator that mediates several BR responses in rice. Suppression of DLT can enhance the phenotypes of BR receptor mutant d61-1, and overexpression of DLT obviously suppressed the BR loss-of-function phenotypes of both d61-1 and Go, suggesting that DLT functions downstream of GSK2 to modulate BR responses. Indeed, GSK2 can interact with DLT and phosphorylate DLT. Moreover, brassinolide treatment can induce the dephosphorylation of DLT, leading to the accumulation of dephosphorylated DLT protein. In GSK2 transgenic plants, the DLT phosphorylation level is dictated by the GSK2 level. These results demonstrate that DLT is a GSK2 substrate, further reinforcing that the BIN2/GSK2 kinase has multiple substrates that carry out various BR responses.
NA	Natural selection of a GSK3 determines rice mesocotyl domestication by coordinating strigolactone and brassinosteroid signaling.	2018	Nat Commun	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Center of Integrative Biology, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Mesocotyl is the crucial organ for pushing buds out of deep water or soil after germination in monocots. Deep direct seeding or mechanized dry seeding cultivation practice requires rice cultivars having long mesocotyl. However, the mechanisms of mesocotyl elongation and domestication remain unknown. Here, our genome-wide association study (GWAS) reveals that natural variations of OsGSK2, a conserved GSK3-like kinase involved in brassinosteroid signaling, determine rice mesocotyl length variation. Variations in the coding region of OsGSK2 alter its kinase activity. It is selected for mesocotyl length variation during domestication. Molecular analyses show that brassinosteroid-promoted mesocotyl elongation functions by suppressing the phosphorylation of an U-type cyclin, CYC U2, by OsGSK2. Importantly, the F-box protein D3, a major positive component in strigolactone signaling, can degrade the OsGSK2-phosphorylated CYC U2 to inhibit mesocotyl elongation. Together, these results suggest that OsGSK2 is selected to regulate mesocotyl length by coordinating strigolactone and brassinosteroid signaling during domestication.
NA	OsBZR1 turnover mediated by OsSK22-regulated U-box E3 ligase OsPUB24 in rice BR response.	2019	Plant J	Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Republic of Korea.	OsBZR1 (Oryza sativa BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1) is the closest rice homolog of the Arabidopsis BZR1 and BES1 (bri1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1)/BZR2 transcription factors. OsBZR1 plays a central role in the rice brassinosteroid signaling pathway. Despite its functional importance, the control mechanism by which the cellular stability of OsBZR1 is regulated has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we report that a rice U-box E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase OsPUB24 acts as a negative regulator in the BR signaling pathway via 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of OsBZR1. The ospub24 T-DNA knock-out mutant and Ubi:RNAi-OsPUB24 knock-down rice plants displayed enhanced seedling growth, increased lamina joint bending, and hypersensitivity to brassinolide (BL). The expressions of the BR biosynthetic genes suppressed by BR in a negative feedback loop were lower in the mutant progeny than in the wild-type rice plants, which indicated increased BR responses in the mutant line. OsPUB24 ubiquitinated OsBZR1, resulting in the proteasomal degradation of OsBZR1. In addition, the stability of OsPUB24 was downregulated by BL and bikinin, an inhibitor of OsSK22 (Oryza sativa Shaggy/GSK3-like kinase 22). OsSK22, the homolog of Arabidopsis BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2) protein kinase, phosphorylated OsPUB24 and elevated the cellular stability of OsPUB24. Our findings suggest that OsPUB24 participates in OsBZR1 turnover and the regulatory networks of OsPUB24, OsSK22, and OsBZR1 are crucial for fine-tuning the BR response in rice.

NA	Rice stripe virus suppresses jasmonic acid-mediated resistance by hijacking brassinosteroid signaling pathway in rice	2020	PLoS Pathog	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.	Rice stripe virus (RSV) is one of the most destructive viral diseases affecting rice production. However, so far, only one RSV resistance gene has been cloned, the molecular mechanisms underlying host-RSV interaction are still poorly understood. Here, we show that increasing levels or signaling of brassinosteroids (BR) and jasmonic acid (JA) can significantly enhance the resistance against RSV. On the contrary, plants impaired in BR or JA signaling are more susceptible to RSV. Moreover, the enhancement of RSV resistance conferred by BR is impaired in OsMYC2 (a key positive regulator of JA response) knockout plants, suggesting that BR-mediated RSV resistance requires active JA pathway. In addition, we found that RSV infection suppresses the endogenous BR levels to increase the accumulation of OsGSK2, a key negative regulator of BR signaling. OsGSK2 physically interacts with OsMYC2, resulting in the degradation of OsMYC2 by phosphorylation and reduces JA-mediated defense to facilitate virus infection. These findings not only reveal a novel molecular mechanism mediating the crosstalk between BR and JA in response to virus infection and deepen our understanding about the interaction of virus and plants, but also suggest new effective means of breeding RSV resistant crops using genetic engineering.
NA	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	2021	J Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Guangxi Key Laboratory of Rice Genetics and Breeding, Nanning, 530007 China.	Although morphology and grain size are important to rice growth and yield, the identity of abundant natural allelic variations that determine agronomically important differences in crops is unknown. Here, we characterized the function of mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 from Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt encoded by OrMKK3. Different alternative splicing variants occurred in OrMKK3. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OrMKK3 fusion proteins localized to the cell membrane and nuclei of rice protoplasts. Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OrMKK3 is well conserved in plants while showing large amounts of variation between indica, japonica, and wild rice. In addition, OrMKK3 slightly influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression levels of BR-related genes. Our findings thus identify a new gene, OrMKK3, influencing morphology and grain size and that represents a possible link between mitogen-activated protein kinase and BR response pathways in grain growth.
