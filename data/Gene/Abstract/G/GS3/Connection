GS3	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
APG|OsPIL16	GS3	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
GS3	SRS3|OsKINESIN-13A	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
GS3	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.
GS3	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level
GS3	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	The results clearly showed that qSW5 and GW2 positively regulate the expression of GS3
GS3	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	GS3	The additive effects of GS3 and qGL3 on rice grain length regulation revealed by genetic and transcriptome comparisons.	The additive effects of GS3 and qGL3 on rice grain length regulation revealed by genetic and transcriptome comparisons.
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	GS3	The additive effects of GS3 and qGL3 on rice grain length regulation revealed by genetic and transcriptome comparisons.	To investigate the genetic interaction between two major grain length loci of rice, GS3 and qGL3, we developed two near-isogenic lines (NILs), NIL-GS3 (GS3/qGL3) and NIL-qgl3 (gs3/qgl3), in the genetic background of 93-11 (gs3/qGL3) by conventional backcrossing and marker-assisted selection (MAS)
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	GS3	The additive effects of GS3 and qGL3 on rice grain length regulation revealed by genetic and transcriptome comparisons.	By comparing the grain lengths of 93-11, NIL-GS3, NIL-qgl3 and NIL-GS3/qgl3, we investigated the effects of GS3, qGL3 and GS3 GL3 interaction on grain length based on two-way ANOVA
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	GS3	The additive effects of GS3 and qGL3 on rice grain length regulation revealed by genetic and transcriptome comparisons.	We found that GS3 and qGL3 had additive effects on rice grain length regulation
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	GS3	The additive effects of GS3 and qGL3 on rice grain length regulation revealed by genetic and transcriptome comparisons.	Comparative analysis of primary panicle transcriptomes in the four NILs revealed that the genes affected by GS3 and qGL3 partially overlapped, and both loci might be involved in brassinosteroid signaling
GS3	RGG1	Function of heterotrimeric G-protein gamma subunit RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in rice by elevating detoxification of ROS.	In salinity-stressed RGG1 transgenic lines, the transcript levels of RGG2, RGB, RGA, DEP1, and GS3 also increased in addition to RGG1
GGC2	GS3	A G-protein pathway determines grain size in rice.	 Three G¦Ã proteins, DEP1, GGC2 and GS3, antagonistically regulate grain size
