The GS3 locus located in the pericentromeric region of rice chromosome 3 has been frequently identified as a major QTL for both grain weight (a yield trait) and grain length (a quality trait) in the literature. Near isogenic lines of GS3 were developed by successive crossing and backcrossing Minghui 63 (large grain) with Chuan 7 (small grain), using Minghui 63 as the recurrent parent. Analysis of a random subpopulation of 201 individuals from the BC3F2 progeny confirmed that the GS3 locus explained 80-90% of the variation for grain weight and length in this population. In addition, this locus was resolved as a minor QTL for grain width and thickness. Using 1,384 individuals with recessive phenotype (large grain) from a total of 5,740 BC3F2 plants and 11 molecular markers based on sequence information, GS3 was mapped to a DNA fragment approximately 7.9 kb in length. A full-length cDNA corresponding to the target region was identified, which provided complete sequence information for the GS3 candidate. This gene consists of five exons and encodes 232 amino acids with a putative PEBP-like domain, a transmembrane region, a putative TNFR/NGFR family cysteine-rich domain and a VWFC module. Comparative sequencing analysis identified a nonsense mutation, shared among all the large-grain varieties tested in comparison with the small grain varieties, in the second exon of the putative GS3 gene. This mutation causes a 178-aa truncation in the C-terminus of the predicted protein, suggesting that GS3 may function as a negative regulator for grain size. Cloning of such a gene provided the opportunity for fully characterizing the regulatory mechanism and related processes during grain development.
1323.full.pdf	Evolutionary history of GS3, a gene conferring grain length in rice	2009	Genetics	Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.	Unlike maize and wheat, where artificial selection is associated with an almost uniform increase in seed or grain size, domesticated rice exhibits dramatic phenotypic diversity for grain size and shape. Here we clone and characterize GS3, an evolutionarily important gene controlling grain size in rice. We show that GS3 is highly expressed in young panicles in both short- and long-grained varieties but is not expressed in leaves or panicles after flowering, and we use genetic transformation to demonstrate that the dominant allele for short grain complements the long-grain phenotype. An association study revealed that a C to A mutation in the second exon of GS3 (A allele) was associated with enhanced grain length in Oryza sativa but was absent from other Oryza species. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was elevated and there was a 95.7% reduction in nucleotide diversity (theta(pi)) across the gene in accessions carrying the A allele, suggesting positive selection for long grain. Haplotype analysis traced the origin of the long-grain allele to a Japonica-like ancestor and demonstrated introgression into the Indica gene pool. This study indicates a critical role for GS3 in defining the seed morphologies of modern subpopulations of O. sativa and enhances the potential for genetic manipulation of grain size in rice.
63_77.pdf	Multiple and independent origins of short seeded alleles of GS3 in rice	2013	Breed Sci	Faculty of Agriculture, Graduate School, Kyushu University , 6-10-1, Hakozaki, Higashi, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.	GRAIN SIZE 3 (GS3) is a cloned gene that is related to seed length. Here we report the discovery of new deletion alleles at the GS3 locus, each of which confer short seed. We selected ten short seeded cultivars from a collection of 282 diverse cultivars. Sequence analysis across the GS3 gene in these ten cultivars identified three novel alleles and a known allele that contain several independent deletion(s) in the fifth exon of GS. These independent deletion variants each resulted in a frameshift mutation that caused a premature stop codon, and they were functionally similar to one another. Each coded for a truncated gene product that behaved as an incomplete dominant allele and conferred a short seeded phenotype. Haplotype analysis of these sequence variants indicated that two of the variants were of japonica origin, and two were from indica. Transformation experiments demonstrated that one of the deletion alleles of GS3 decrease the cell number in the upper epidermis of the glume, resulting in a significant reduction in seed length. The multiple and independent origins of these short seeded alleles indicate that farmers and early breeders imposed artificial selection favoring short seeds.
69822640.pdf	GS3 participates in stigma exsertion as well as seed length in rice	2011	Breeding Science	Plant Breeding Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Graduate School, Kyushu University	Stigma exsertion is an important trait that contributes to the improvement of seed production in hybrid rice. We demonstrate that GS3, one of the genes regulating seed length, also regulates stigma length and participates in stigma exsertion in rice. GS3 mRNA is expressed in the basal part of the young stigma, and a nonsense mutation in the second exon of GS3 causes an increase in cell number, resulting in elongation of the stigma. Manipulation of GS3 should contribute to the improvement of hybrid seed-production efficiency.
Fan CC_TAG(Xing).pdf	A causal C-A mutation in the second exon of GS3 highly associated with rice grain length and validated as a functional marker	2009	Theor Appl Genet	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070, Wuhan, China.	Comparative sequencing of GS3, the most important grain length (GL) QTL, has shown that differentiation of rice GL might be principally due to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) between C and A in the second exon. A total of 180 varieties representing a wide range of rice germplasm were used for association analysis between C-A mutation and GL in order to confirm the potential causal mutation. A cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker, SF28, was developed based on the C-A polymorphism in the GS3 gene. A total of 142 varieties carried allele C with GL from 6.4 to 8.8 mm, while the remaining 38 varieties carried allele A with GL from 8.8 to 10.7 mm. Twenty-four unlinked SSR markers were selected to genotype 180 varieties for population structure analysis. Population structure was observed when the population was classified to three subpopulations. Average GL of either genotype A or genotype C within japonica among the three subpopulations had no significant difference from that in indica, respectively, although indica rice had longer grains on average than japonica in the 180 varieties. However, genotype C always had longer grain length on average than genotype A among three subpopulations. The mutation could explain 79.1, 66.4 and 34.7% of GL variation in the three subpopulations, respectively. These results clearly confirmed the mutation between C and A was highly associated with GL. The SF28 could be a functional marker for improvement of rice grain length.
journal.pone.0031325.pdf	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	2012	PLoS One	Graduate School of Horticulture, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.	Grain size is a major yield component in rice, and partly controlled by the sizes of the lemma and palea. Molecular mechanisms controlling the sizes of these organs largely remain unknown. In this study, we show that an antagonistic pair of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins is involved in determining rice grain length by controlling cell length in the lemma/palea. Overexpression of an atypical bHLH, named POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1), in lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in transgenic rice. PGL1 is an atypical non-DNA-binding bHLH and assumed to function as an inhibitor of a typical DNA-binding bHLH through heterodimerization. We identified the interaction partner of PGL1 and named it ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG). PGL1 and APG interacted in vivo and localized in the nucleus. As expected, silencing of APG produced the same phenotype as overexpression of PGL1, suggesting antagonistic roles for the two genes. Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants. Observation of the inner epidermal cells of lemma revealed that are caused by increased cell length. PGL1-APG represents a new grain length and weight-controlling pathway in which APG is a negative regulator whose function is inhibited by PGL1.
PNAS-2010-Mao-1014419107.pdf	Linking differential domain functions of the GS3 protein to natural variation of grain size in rice	2010	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Grain yield in many cereal crops is largely determined by grain size. Here we report the genetic and molecular characterization of GS3, a major quantitative trait locus for grain size. It functions as a negative regulator of grain size and organ size. The wild-type isoform is composed of four putative domains: a plant-specific organ size regulation (OSR) domain in the N terminus, a transmembrane domain, a tumor necrosis factor receptor/nerve growth factor receptor (TNFR/NGFR) family cysteine-rich domain, and a von Willebrand factor type C (VWFC) in the C terminus. These domains function differentially in grain size regulation. The OSR domain is both necessary and sufficient for functioning as a negative regulator. The wild-type allele corresponds to medium grain. Loss of function of OSR results in long grain. The C-terminal TNFR/NGFR and VWFC domains show an inhibitory effect on the OSR function; loss-of-function mutations of these domains produced very short grain. This study linked the functional domains of the GS3 protein to natural variation of grain size in rice.

Both the N-terminal region and the C-terminal domains of AGG3 are necessary for the function of AGG3. By contrast, analysis of a series of AGG3 derivatives with deletions in specific domains showed that the deletion of any of these domains cannot completely abolish the function of AGG3. The GFP-AGG3 fusion protein is localized to the plasma membrane. The predicted transmembrane domain plays an important role in the plasma membrane localization of AGG3. Genetic analyses revealed that AGG3 action requires a functional G protein alpha subunit (GPA1) and G protein beta subunit (AGB1). * Our findings demonstrate that AGG3, GPA1 and AGB1 act in the same genetic pathway to influence organ size and shape in A. thaliana.
NA	Improving rice grain length through updating the GS3 locus of an elite variety Kongyu 131.	2018	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Plant Gene Research Center, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Traditional crop breeding has made significant achievement meet food needs worldwide. However, the way has some inevitable problems including time-consuming, laborious, low predictability and reproducibility. In this study, we updated the GRAIN SIZE 3 (GS3) locus to improve the grain length of a major cultivate variety of Kongyu 131 at Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost region of China. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is used for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping.The improved line introgressed about 117<U+00A0>kb segment including gs3 allele from donor GKBR by using five SNP markers designed within and without GS3 locus, and the background recovery ratio of the recurrent parent genome is about 99.55% that are detected by 219 SNP markers evenly distributed on the 12 chromosomes. The field trial indicates that grain length, 100-grain weight and total grain weight per plant of the improved line raised by 12.05%, 16.30% and 4.47%, respectively, compared with Kongyu 131.This result demonstrates that update the GS3 locus is a feasible and efficient and accurate way can be applied to improve grain size of rice.
NA	Bin-based genome-wide association studies reveal superior alleles for improvement of appearance quality using a 4-way MAGIC population in rice	2020	J Adv Res	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Introduction: The multiparental population provides us the chance to identify superior alleles controlling a trait for genetic improvement. Genome wide association studies at bin level (bin-GWAS) are expected to be more power in QTL mapping than GWAS at SNP level (SNP-GWAS).  Objectives: This study is to estimate genetic effects of QTL conferring grain appearance quality in rice by SNP-GWAS and bin-GWAS, compare their power in QTL mapping and identify the superior alleles of all detected QTL from 4 parents for genetic improvement.  Methods: A 4-way MAGIC population and its four founders were cultivated in two environments to dissect the genetic basis of rice grain appearance quality. Both SNP-GWAS and bin-GWAS were conducted for QTL mapping. Multiple comparison among 4 parental bin/alleles was used to identify the superior alleles.  Results: A total of 16 and 20 QTL associated with grain appearance quality were identified by SNP- and bin-GWAS, respectively. A minor chalkiness QTL qPGWC8.2/qDEC8 was assigned to a 30-kb genomic region, in which OsMH_08T0121900 is the potential candidate gene because its encoded protein, glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase precursor is involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway. The superior parental alleles for GS3, GL3.1, GW5, GW7, and Chalk5 and two QTLs were almost carried by the high-quality parents Cypress and Yuejingsimiao (YJSM), while the poor-quality parent Guichao-2 (GC2) always carried the inferior alleles. The top five recombinant inbred lines with the highest quality of grain shape and chalkiness traits all carried gene combinations of superior alleles.  Conclusions: Both SNP- and bin-GWAS methods are encouraged for joint QTL mapping with MAGIC population. qPGWC8.2/qDEC8 is a novel candidate gene strongly associated with chalkiness. The superior alleles of GS3, GW5, GL3.1, GW7, Chalk5 and qPGWC8.2 were identified, and the pyramiding of these superior alleles is helpful to improve rice appearance quality.
