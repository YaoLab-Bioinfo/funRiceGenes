NA	Ghd2, a CONSTANS-like gene, confers drought sensitivity through regulation of senescence in rice.	2016	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	CONSTANS (CO)-like genes have been intensively investigated for their roles in the regulation of photoperiodic flowering, but very limited information has been reported on their functions in other biological processes. Here, we found that a CO-like gene, Ghd2 (Grain number, plant height, and heading date2), which can increase the yield potential under normal growth condition just like its homologue Ghd7, is involved in the regulation of leaf senescence and drought resistance. Ghd2 is expressed mainly in the rice (Oryza sativa) leaf with the highest level detected at the grain-filling stage, and it is down-regulated by drought stress conditions. Overexpression of Ghd2 resulted in significantly reduced drought resistance, while its knockout mutant showed the opposite phenotype. The earlier senescence symptoms and the transcript up-regulation of many senescence-associated genes (SAGs) in Ghd2-overexpressing transgenic rice plants under drought stress conditions indicate that Ghd2 plays essential roles in accelerating drought-induced leaf senescence in rice. Moreover, developmental and dark-induced leaf senescence was accelerated in the Ghd2-overexpressing rice and delayed in the ghd2 mutant. Several SAGs were confirmed to be regulated by Ghd2 using a transient expression system in rice protoplasts. Ghd2 interacted with several regulatory proteins, including OsARID3, OsPURα, and three 14-3-3 proteins. OsARID3 and OsPURα showed expression patterns similar to Ghd2 in rice leaves, with the highest levels at the grain-filling stage, whereas OsARID3 and the 14-3-3 genes responded differently to drought stress conditions. These results indicate that Ghd2 functions as a regulator by integrating environmental signals with the senescence process into a developmental programme through interaction with different proteins.
NA	The CCT transcriptional activator Ghd2 constantly delays the heading date by upregulating CO3 in rice.	2023	J Genet Genomics	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei 430070, China.	CONSTANS, CO-like, and TOC1 (CCT) family genes play important roles in regulating heading date, which exerts a large impact on the regional and seasonal adaptation of rice. Previous studies have shown that Grain number, plant height, and heading date2 (Ghd2) exhibit a negative response to drought stress by directly upregulating Rubisco activase and exerting a negative effect on heading date. However, the target gene of Ghd2 regulating heading date is still unknown. In this study, CO3 is identified by analyzing ChIP-seq data. Ghd2 activates CO3 expression by binding to the CO3 promoter through its CCT domain. EMSA experiments show that the motif CCACTA in the CO3 promoter was recognized by Ghd2. A comparison of the heading dates among plants with CO3 knocked out or overexpressed and double mutants overexpressing Ghd2 with CO3 knocked out shows that CO3 negatively and constantly regulates flowering by repressing the transcription of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1. In addition, the target genes of CO3 are explored via a comprehensive analysis of DAP-seq data and RNA-seq data. Taken together, these results suggest that Ghd2 directly binds to the downstream gene CO3, and the Ghd2-CO3 module constantly delays heading date via the Ehd1-mediated pathway.
