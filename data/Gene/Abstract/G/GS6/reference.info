A dwarf mutant, dwarf 62 (d62), was isolated from rice cultivar 93-11 by mutagenesis with gamma-rays. Under normal growth conditions, the mutant had multiple abnormal phenotypes, such as dwarfism, wide and dark-green leaf blades, reduced tiller numbers, late and asynchronous heading, short roots, partial male sterility, etc. Genetic analysis indicated that the abnormal phenotypes were controlled by the recessive mutation of a single nuclear gene. Using molecular markers, the D62 gene was fine mapped in 131-kb region at the short arm of chromosome 6. Positional cloning of D62 gene revealed that it was the same locus as DLT/OsGRAS-32, which encodes a member of the GRAS family. In previous studies, the DLT/OsGRAS-32 is confirmed to play positive roles in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Sequence analysis showed that the d62 carried a 2-bp deletion in ORF region of D62 gene which led to a loss-of-function mutation. The function of D62 gene was confirmed by complementation experiment. RT-PCR analysis and promoter activity analysis showed that the D62 gene expressed in all tested tissues including roots, stems, leaves and panicles of rice plant. The d62 mutant exhibited decreased activity of alpha-amylase in endosperm and reduced content of endogenous GA(1). The expression levels of gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic genes including OsCPS1, OsKS1, OsKO1, OsKAO, OsGA20ox2/SD1 and OsGA2ox3 were significantly increased in d62 mutant. Briefly, these results demonstrated that the D62 (DLT/OsGRAS-32) not only participated in the regulation of BR signaling, but also influenced GA metabolism in rice.
2562.pdf	DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING acts as a direct downstream target of a GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase to mediate brassinosteroid responses in rice	2012	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	In Arabidopsis thaliana, the GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2) plays a critical role in the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway by negatively regulating the activities of bri1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1/BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 family transcription factors that regulate the expression of downstream BR-responsive genes. In this study, we analyzed the function of a rice (Oryza sativa) GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase (GSK2), which is one of the orthologs of BIN2. Overexpression of GSK2 (Go) led to plants with typical BR loss-of-function phenotypes, and suppression of GSK2 resulted in enhanced BR signaling phenotypes. DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (DLT) is a positive regulator that mediates several BR responses in rice. Suppression of DLT can enhance the phenotypes of BR receptor mutant d61-1, and overexpression of DLT obviously suppressed the BR loss-of-function phenotypes of both d61-1 and Go, suggesting that DLT functions downstream of GSK2 to modulate BR responses. Indeed, GSK2 can interact with DLT and phosphorylate DLT. Moreover, brassinolide treatment can induce the dephosphorylation of DLT, leading to the accumulation of dephosphorylated DLT protein. In GSK2 transgenic plants, the DLT phosphorylation level is dictated by the GSK2 level. These results demonstrate that DLT is a GSK2 substrate, further reinforcing that the BIN2/GSK2 kinase has multiple substrates that carry out various BR responses.
j.1365-313X.2009.03825.x.pdf	DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING, a new member of the GRAS family, plays positive roles in brassinosteroid signaling in rice	2009	The Plant Journal	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Rapid progress has been made regarding the understanding of brassinosteroid (BR) signaling in Arabidopsis. However, little is known about BR signaling in monotyledons. Here, we characterized a rice dwarf and low-tillering (dlt) mutant and cloned the corresponding gene via map-based cloning. DLT encodes a new member of the plant-specific GRAS family. The dwarf phenotype of dlt is similar to BR-deficient or signaling mutants in rice. In addition, both lamina bending and coleoptile elongation assays show that dlt is insensitive or much less responsive to brassinolide (BL), the most active BR, suggesting that DLT is involved in BR signaling. Consistent with this conclusion, the accumulation of transcripts of BR biosynthesis genes in the dlt mutant indicated that DLT is involved in feedback inhibition of BR biosynthesis genes. In addition, transcription of several other BR-regulated genes is altered in the dlt mutant. Finally, consistent with the fact that DLT is also negatively feedback-regulated by BR treatment, a gel mobility shift assay showed that OsBZR1 can bind to the DLT promoter through the BR-response element. Taken together, these studies have enabled us to identify a new signaling component that is involved in several specific BR responses in rice.
jipb12062.pdf	GS6, a member of the GRAS gene family, negatively regulates grain size in rice	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, National Center for Evaluation of Agricultural Wild Plants (Rice), MOE Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, Beijing 100193, China; Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Grain size is an important yield-related trait in rice. Intensive artificial selection for grain size during domestication is evidenced by the larger grains of most of today's cultivars compared with their wild relatives. However, the molecular genetic control of rice grain size is still not well characterized. Here, we report the identification and cloning of Grain Size 6 (GS6), which plays an important role in reducing grain size in rice. A premature stop at the +348 position in the coding sequence (CDS) of GS6 increased grain width and weight significantly. Alignment of the CDS regions of GS6 in 90 rice materials revealed three GS6 alleles. Most japonica varieties (95%) harbor the Type I haplotype, and 62.9% of indica varieties harbor the Type II haplotype. Association analysis revealed that the Type I haplotype tends to increase the width and weight of grains more than either of the Type II or Type III haplotypes. Further investigation of genetic diversity and the evolutionary mechanisms of GS6 showed that the GS6 gene was strongly selected in japonica cultivars. In addition, a "ggc" repeat region identified in the region that encodes the GRAS domain of GS6 played an important historic role in the domestication of grain size in rice. Knowledge of the function of GS6 might aid efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control grain development and evolution in rice plants, and could facilitate the genetic improvement of rice yield.
NA	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	2021	J Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Guangxi Key Laboratory of Rice Genetics and Breeding, Nanning, 530007 China.	Although morphology and grain size are important to rice growth and yield, the identity of abundant natural allelic variations that determine agronomically important differences in crops is unknown. Here, we characterized the function of mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 from Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt encoded by OrMKK3. Different alternative splicing variants occurred in OrMKK3. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OrMKK3 fusion proteins localized to the cell membrane and nuclei of rice protoplasts. Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OrMKK3 is well conserved in plants while showing large amounts of variation between indica, japonica, and wild rice. In addition, OrMKK3 slightly influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression levels of BR-related genes. Our findings thus identify a new gene, OrMKK3, influencing morphology and grain size and that represents a possible link between mitogen-activated protein kinase and BR response pathways in grain growth.
