GF14c	flower	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	Functional analysis using either GF14c overexpression or knockout transgenic rice plants indicated that this interaction plays a role in the regulation of flowering
GF14c	flower	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	GF14c-overexpressing plants exhibited a delay in flowering and the knockout mutants displayed early flowering relative to the wild-type plants under short-day conditions
GF14c	flower	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	These results suggest that GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering by interacting with Hd3a
GF14c	flower	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a
GF14c	drought	Sugar starvation- and GA-inducible calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 feedback regulates GA biosynthesis and activates a 14-3-3 protein to confer drought tolerance in rice seedlings	Overexpression of either constitutively active OsCDPK1 or GF14c enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings
GF14c	seedling	Sugar starvation- and GA-inducible calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 feedback regulates GA biosynthesis and activates a 14-3-3 protein to confer drought tolerance in rice seedlings	Overexpression of either constitutively active OsCDPK1 or GF14c enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings
GF14c	drought tolerance	Sugar starvation- and GA-inducible calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 feedback regulates GA biosynthesis and activates a 14-3-3 protein to confer drought tolerance in rice seedlings	Overexpression of either constitutively active OsCDPK1 or GF14c enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings
GF14c	immunity	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.
GF14c	immunity	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.	 Taken together, these findings uncover the important roles of OsSCL7 and GF14c in plant immunity and a potential mechanism by which plants fine-tune immunity by regulating the protein stability of a GRAS protein via a 14-3-3 protein
