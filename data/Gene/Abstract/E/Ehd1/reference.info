0180926.pdf	Ehd1, a B-type response regulator in rice, confers short-day promotion of flowering and controls FT-like gene expression independently of Hd1	2004	Genes Dev	Plant Breeding Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan. kdoi@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp	Two evolutionarily distant plant species, rice (Oryza sativa L.), a short-day (SD) plant, and Arabidopsis thaliana, a long-day plant, share a conserved genetic network controlling photoperiodic flowering. The orthologous floral regulators-rice Heading date 1 (Hd1) and Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO)-integrate circadian clock and external light signals into mRNA expression of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) group floral inducer. Here, we report that the rice Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) gene, which confers SD promotion of flowering in the absence of a functional allele of Hd1, encodes a B-type response regulator that might not have an ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome. Ehd1 mRNA was induced by 1-wk SD treatment, and Ehd1 may promote flowering by inducing FT-like gene expression only under SD conditions. Microarray analysis further revealed a few MADS box genes downstream of Ehd1. Our results indicate that a novel two-component signaling cascade is integrated into the conserved pathway in the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice.

S-Adenosyl-l-methionine synthetase (SAMS) [EC 2.5.1.6] catalyzes to produce SAM (S-adenosyl-l-methionine), a universal methyl group donor in biochemical reactions in cells. However, less is known how SAMS controls plant development. Here, we demonstrate that OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 are essential for histone H3K4me3 and DNA methylation to regulate gene expression related to flowering in Oryza sativa. RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice with downregulated transcripts of OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes, including dwarfism, reduced fertility, delayed germination, as well as late flowering. Delayed germination was largely rescued by application of SAM in the knockdown lines. Knockdown of OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 led to distinguished late flowering and greatly reduced the expression of the flowering key genes, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Hd3a and RFT1 (rice FT-like genes). Moreover, the histone H3K4me3 and symmetric DNA methylation at these genes were greatly reduced. Thus, SAM deficiency suppressing DNA and H3K4me3 transmethylations at flowering key genes led to a late-flowering phenotype in rice. This information could help elucidate the mechanism of epigenetic control flowering transition.

Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1	2011	Plant Cell Rep	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Heading date in rice is an important agronomic trait controlled by several genes. In this study, flowering time of variety Dianjingyou 1 (DJY1) was earlier than a near-isogenic line (named NIL) carried chromosome segment from African rice on chromosome 3S, when grown in both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions. By analyzing a large F2 population from NIL x DJY1, the locus DTH3 (QTL for days to heading on chromosome 3) controlling early heading date in DJY1 was fine mapped to a 64-kb segment which contained only one annotated gene, a MIKC-type MADS-box protein. We detected a 6-bp deletion and a single base substitution in the C-domain by sequencing DTH3 in DJY1 compared with dth3 in NIL, and overexpression of DTH3 caused early flowering in callus. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the transcript level of dth3 in NIL was lower than that DTH3 in DJY1 in both LD and SD conditions. The Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) which promotes the RFT1, was up-regulated by DTH3 in both LD and SD conditions. Based on Indel and dCAPs marker analysis, the dth3 allele was only present in African rice accessions. A phylogenetic analysis based on microsatellite genotyping suggested that African rice had a close genetic relationship to O. rufipogon and O. latifolia, and was similar to japonica cultivars. DTH3 affected flowering time and had no significant effect on the main agronomic traits.
10.1007-s00425-008-0742-0.pdf	OsCO3, a CONSTANS-LIKE gene, controls flowering by negatively regulating the expression of FT-like genes under SD conditions in rice	2008	Planta	Plant Signaling Network Research Center, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, South Korea.	The photoperiod is an important environmental stress that determines flowering time. The CONSTANS (CO) and Heading date 1 (Hd1) genes are known to be central integrators of the photoperiod pathway in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively. Although they are both members of the CONSTANS-LIKE (COL) family and have two B-boxes and a CCT domain, rice also possesses novel COL genes that are not found in Arabidopsis. Here, we demonstrate that a novel COL gene, OsCO3, containing a single B-box and a CCT domain, modulates photoperiodic flowering in rice. The circadian expression pattern of OsCO3 mRNA oscillated in a different phase from Hd1 and was similar to that of OsCO3 pre-mRNA, suggesting that the diurnal expression pattern of OsCO3 transcripts may be regulated at the transcriptional level. Overexpression of OsCO3 specifically caused late flowering under short day (SD) conditions relative to wild-type rice plants. The expression of Hd3a and FTL decreased in these transgenic plants, whereas the expression of Hd1, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), OsMADS51, and OsMADS50 did not significantly change. Our results suggest that OsCO3 primarily controls flowering time under SD conditions by negatively regulating Hd3a and FTL expression, independent of the SD-promotion pathway.

In rice, 30 different Dof genes have been identified through genome analysis. Here we report the functional characteristics of a rice Dof gene, OsDof12, which encodes a predicted Dof protein. The nuclear localization of OsDof12 was investigated by the transient expression assays of the OsDof12-GFP fusion protein in onion epidermal cells. Trans-activation assays in a yeast one-hybrid system indicated that OsDof12 had transcriptional activity. RNA expression analyses showed that the expression of OsDof12 was not tissue-specific in general and fluctuated at different development stages in rice. In addition, OsDof12 was strongly inhibited by dark treatments. The transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12 showed early flowering under long-day (LD) conditions, whereas OsDof12 overexpression had no effect on flowering time under short-day (SD) conditions. In transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12, the transcription levels of Hd3a and OsMADS14 were up-regulated under LD conditions but not SD conditions, whereas the expression of Hd1, OsMADS51, Ehd1 and OsGI did not change under LD and SD conditions. These results suggested that OsDof12 might regulate flowering by controlling the expression of Hd3a and OsMADS14.
10.1007-s10681-007-9584-2.pdf	Epistasis among the three major flowering time genes in rice: coordinate changes of photoperiod sensitivity, basic vegetative growth and optimum photoperiod	2007	Euphytica	Plant Breeding Laboratory, Graduate School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-8589, Japan	Flowering time is affected not only by photoperiod sensitivity (PS) but also by basic vegetative growth (BVG) and optimum photoperiod (OP), although their developmental and genetic relationships are not well understood. The present study was carried out in rice to examine to what extent these three developmental components are modified by the three flowering time genes, Se1 (= Hd1), Ef1 and e1 (= m-Ef1), which are known to contribute to flowering time in temperate and tropical regions of rice cultivation. Photoperiodic response curves were estimated under controlled conditions of different growth regimes, using eight near-isogenic lines possessing different combinations of the alleles at the three loci. The results showed that each of the components is greatly affected by the main effect of the genes, temperature and their epistasis, indicating that none of the three genes controls flowering time by altering any single component in PS, BVG or OP. Epistasis was detected more frequently among the three genes than reported before, suggesting that epistasis contributes to flowering time by changing PS, BVG and OP differently. The comparison of the nucleotide sequences suggested that Ef1 is the same as Early heading date 1 (Ehd1). Since the two genes Se1 (= Hd1) and Ef1 (= Ehd1) are known to up-regulate the rice homolog of Arabidopsis FT, it is suggested that the detected epistasis may respond to diverse environments by modulating the CO/FT system conserved in flowering plants.
1128.pdf	Molecular dissection of the roles of phytochrome in photoperiodic flowering in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa 277-8561, Japan.	Phytochromes mediate the photoperiodic control of flowering in rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant. Recent molecular genetics studies have revealed a genetic network that enables the critical daylength response of florigen gene expression. Analyses using a rice phytochrome chromophore-deficient mutant, photoperiod sensitivity5, have so far revealed that within this network, phytochromes are required for expression of Grain number, plant height and heading date7 (Ghd7), a floral repressor gene in rice. There are three phytochrome genes in rice, but the roles of each phytochrome family member in daylength response have not previously been defined. Here, we revealed multiple action points for each phytochrome in the critical daylength response of florigen expression by using single and double phytochrome mutant lines of rice. Our results show that either phyA alone or a genetic combination of phyB and phyC can induce Ghd7 mRNA, whereas phyB alone causes some reduction in levels of Ghd7 mRNA. Moreover, phyB and phyA can affect Ghd7 activity and Early heading date1 (a floral inducer) activity in the network, respectively. Therefore, each phytochrome gene of rice has distinct roles, and all of the phytochrome actions coordinately control the critical daylength response of florigen expression in rice.
BBRC.pdf	Ectopic expression of OsLFL1 in rice represses Ehd1 by binding on its promoter	2007	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China.	B3 domain was identified as a novel DNA-binding motif specific to higher plant species. The B3 proteins play important roles in plant development. In the mutant W378, the mutant gene coding OsLFL1, a putative B3 transcription factor gene, was ectopically expressed. In this study, it was found that the flowering promoting gene Ehd1 and its putative downstream genes were all repressed by OsLFL1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses suggest that OsLFL1 binds to the RY cis-elements (CATGCATG) in the promoter of the Ehd1 gene. Thus, ectopically expressed OsLFL1 might repress Ehd1 via binding directly to the RY cis-elements in its promoter.
Development-2009-Komiya-3443-50.pdf	A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice	2009	Development	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Takayama, Ikoma, Japan.	Although some genes that encode sensory or regulatory elements for photoperiodic flowering are conserved between the long-day (LD) plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the short-day (SD) plant rice, the gene networks that control rice flowering, and particularly flowering under LD conditions, are not well understood. We show here that RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1), the closest homolog to Heading date 3a (Hd3a), is a major floral activator under LD conditions. An RFT1:GFP fusion protein localized in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) under LD conditions, suggesting that RFT1 is a florigen gene in rice. Furthermore, mutants in OsMADS50, a rice ortholog of Arabidopsis SUPPRESOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) did not flower up to 300 days after sowing under LD conditions, indicating that OsMADS50, which acts upstream of RFT1, promotes flowering under LD conditions. We propose that both positive (OsMADS50 and Ehd1) and negative (Hd1, phyB and Ghd7) regulators of RFT1 form a gene network that regulates LD flowering in rice. Among these regulators, Ehd1, a rice-specific floral inducer, integrates multiple pathways to regulate RFT1, leading to flowering under appropriate photoperiod conditions. A rice ortholog of Arabidopsis APETALA1, OsMADS14, was expressed in the floral meristem in wild-type but not in RFT1 RNAi plants, suggesting that OsMADS14 is activated by RFT1 protein in the SAM after the transition to flowering. We have thus exposed a network of genes that regulate LD flowering in rice.
j.1365-3040.2009.02008.x.pdf	OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice	2009	Plant Cell Environ	Department of Life Science and Functional Genomic Center, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea.	In much of the tropics and subtropics, rice (Oryza sativa L.) is grown under long days (LDs). Therefore, LD must play a major role in inducing flowering signal in rice. However, little is known on LD-dependent flowering signal in the species. We previously reported that OsMADS50, which is highly homologous to Arabidopsis SOC1, functions as a positive regulator for flowering. However, its detailed photoperiodic mechanism was not yet elucidated. Here, we report the functional analysis of OsMADS50 and its closely related gene OsMADS56. Knock-out of OsMADS50 caused a late-flowering phenotype only under LD conditions. Overexpression of OsMADS56 (56OX) also resulted in delayed flowering under LD. In the osmads50 mutants and 56OX transgenic plants, transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 were reduced, although that of OsLFL1 increased. On the other hand, mRNA levels of OsGI, Hd1, OsId1, OsDof12, Ghd7, Hd6 and SE5 were unchanged. These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicated an interaction between those two proteins as well as their formation of homodimers. These results suggest that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 may form a complex that regulates downstream target genes.
j.1365-313X.2008.03667.x.pdf	Rice Indeterminate 1 (OsId1) is necessary for the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) regardless of photoperiod	2008	Plant J	Division of Applied Life Science (BK21 Program), Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Research Center (PMBBRC), Environmental Biotechnology National Core Research Center, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 660-701, Korea.	Indeterminate 1 (Id1), a classical flowering gene first reported in 1946, is one of the earliest genes whose expression in leaf tissues affects the floral transition in the shoot meristem. How Id1 is integrated into the flowering process is largely unknown. In this study, we examined the genetic action of the rice (Oryza sativa) ortholog OsId1. In rice, OsId1 is preferentially expressed in young leaves, but the overall expression pattern is broader than that in maize (Zea mays). OsId1 is able to activate transcription in yeast. RNAi mutants show a delay in flowering under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions. OsId1 regulates the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) and its downstream genes, including Hd3a (a rice ortholog of FT) and RFT1 (Rice Flowering Locus T1), under both SD and LD conditions. In rice, the expression of Ehd1 is also controlled by the photoperiodic flowering genes OsGI (a rice ortholog of GI) and OsMADS51. However, the expression of OsId1 is independent of OsGI, OsMADS51, and OsMADS50 (a rice SOC1 ortholog). This study demonstrates that the activation of Ehd1 by OsId1 is required for the promotion of flowering.
j.1365-313X.2010.04226.x.pdf	OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB	2010	Plant J	Department of Life Science, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang 790-784, Korea.	Plants recognize environmental factors to determine flowering time. CONSTANS (CO) plays a central role in the photoperiod flowering pathway of Arabidopsis, and CO protein stability is modulated by photoreceptors. In rice, Hd1, an ortholog of CO, acts as a flowering promoter, and phytochromes repress Hd1 expression. Here, we investigated the functioning of OsCOL4, a member of the CONSTANS-like (COL) family in rice. OsCOL4 null mutants flowered early under short or long days. In contrast, OsCOL4 activation-tagging mutants (OsCOL4-D) flowered late in either environment. Transcripts of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 were increased in the oscol4 mutants, but reduced in the OsCOL4-D mutants. This finding indicates that OsCOL4 is a constitutive repressor functioning upstream of Ehd1. By comparison, levels of Hd1, OsID1, OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 transcripts were not significantly changed in oscol4 or OsCOL4-D, suggesting that OsCOL4 functions independently from previously reported flowering pathways. In osphyB mutants, OsCOL4 expression was decreased and osphyB oscol4 double mutants flowered at the same time as the osphyB single mutants, indicating OsCOL4 functions downstream of OsphyB. We also present evidence for two independent pathways through which OsPhyB controls flowering time. These pathways are: (i) night break-sensitive, which does not need OsCOL4; and (ii) night break-insensitive, in which OsCOL4 functions between OsphyB and Ehd1.
j.1365-313X.2011.04517.x.pdf	Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering	2011	Plant J	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Oryza sativa (rice) flowers in response to photoperiod, and is a facultative short-day (SD) plant. Under SD conditions, flowering is promoted through the activation of FT-like genes (rice florigens) by Heading date 1 (Hd1, a rice CONSTANS homolog) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1, with no ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome). On the other hand, under long-day (LD) conditions, flowering is delayed by the repressive function of Hd1 on FT-like genes and by downregulation of Ehd1 by the flowering repressor Ghd7 - a unique pathway in rice. We report here that an early heading date 3 (ehd3) mutant flowered later than wild-type plants, particularly under LD conditions, regardless of the Hd1-deficient background. Map-based cloning revealed that Ehd3 encodes a nuclear protein that contains a putative transcriptional regulator with two plant homeodomain (PHD) finger motifs. To identify the role of Ehd3 within the gene regulatory network for rice flowering, we compared the transcript levels of genes related to rice flowering in wild-type plants and ehd3 mutants. Increased transcription of Ghd7 under LD conditions and reduced transcription of downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes in the ehd3 mutants suggested that Ehd3 normally functions as an LD downregulator of Ghd7 in floral induction. Furthermore, Ehd3 ghd7 plants flowered earlier and show higher Ehd1 transcript levels than ehd3 ghd7 plants, suggesting a Ghd7-independent role of Ehd3 in the upregulation of Ehd1. Our results demonstrate that the PHD-finger gene Ehd3 acts as a promoter in the unique genetic pathway responsible for photoperiodic flowering in rice.

Asian rice, Oryza sativa, consists of two major subspecies, indica and japonica, which are physiologically differentiated and adapted to different latitudes. Genes for photoperiod sensitivity are likely targets of selection along latitude. We examined the footprints of natural and artificial selections for four major genes of the photoperiod pathway, namely PHYTOCHROME B (PhyB), HEADING DATE 1 (Hd1), HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a), and EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (Ehd1), by investigation of the patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms in cultivated and wild rice. Geographical subdivision between tropical and subtropical O. rufipogon was found for all of the photoperiod genes in plants divided by the Tropic of Cancer (TOC). All of these genes, except for PhyB, were characterized by the existence of clades that split a long time ago and that corresponded to latitudinal subdivisions, and revealed a likely diversifying selection. Ssp. indica showed close affinity to tropical O. rufipogon for all genes, while ssp. japonica, which has a much wider range of distribution, displayed complex patterns of differentiation from O. rufipogon, which reflected various agricultural needs in relation to crop yield. In japonica, all genes, except Hd3a, were genetically differentiated at the TOC, while geographical subdivision occurred at 31 degrees N in Hd3a, probably the result of varying photoperiods. Many other features of the photoperiod genes revealed domestication signatures, which included high linkage disequilibrium (LD) within genes, the occurrence of frequent and recurrent non-functional Hd1 mutants in cultivated rice, crossovers between subtropical and tropical alleles of Hd1, and significant LD between Hd1 and Hd3a in japonica and indica.
j.1744-7909.2012.01166.x.pdf	LHD1, an allele of DTH8/Ghd8, controls late heading date in common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon)	2012	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, National Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Flowering at suitable time is very important for plants to adapt to complicated environments and produce their seeds successfully for reproduction. In rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) photoperiod regulation is one of the important factors for controlling heading date. Common wild rice, the ancestor of cultivated rice, exhibits a late heading date and a more sensitive photoperiodic response than cultivated rice. Here, through map-based cloning, we identified a major quantitative trait loci (QTL) LHD1 (Late Heading Date 1), an allele of DTH8/Ghd8, which controls the late heading date of wild rice and encodes a putative HAP3/NF-YB/CBF-A subunit of the CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor. Sequence analysis revealed that several variants in the coding region of LHD1 were correlated with a late heading date, and a further complementary study successfully rescued the phenotype. These results suggest that a functional site for LHD1 could be among those variants present in the coding region. We also found that LHD1 could down-regulate the expression of several floral transition activators such as Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 under long-day conditions, but not under short-day conditions. This indicates that LHD1 may delay flowering by repressing the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 under long-day conditions.
journal.pgen.1003281.pdf	Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice	2013	PLoS Genet	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Land plants have evolved increasingly complex regulatory modes of their flowering time (or heading date in crops). Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a short-day plant that flowers more rapidly in short-day but delays under long-day conditions. Previous studies have shown that the CO-FT module initially identified in long-day plants (Arabidopsis) is evolutionary conserved in short-day plants (Hd1-Hd3a in rice). However, in rice, there is a unique Ehd1-dependent flowering pathway that is Hd1-independent. Here, we report isolation and characterization of a positive regulator of Ehd1, Early heading date 4 (Ehd4). ehd4 mutants showed a never flowering phenotype under natural long-day conditions. Map-based cloning revealed that Ehd4 encodes a novel CCCH-type zinc finger protein, which is localized to the nucleus and is able to bind to nucleic acids in vitro and transactivate transcription in yeast, suggesting that it likely functions as a transcriptional regulator. Ehd4 expression is most active in young leaves with a diurnal expression pattern similar to that of Ehd1 under both short-day and long-day conditions. We show that Ehd4 up-regulates the expression of the "florigen" genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known Ehd1 regulators. Strikingly, Ehd4 is highly conserved in the Oryza genus including wild and cultivated rice, but has no homologs in other species, suggesting that Ehd4 is originated along with the diversification of the Oryza genus from the grass family during evolution. We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice.
journal.pone.0043705.pdf	OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering	2012	PLoS One	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.	Arabidopsis thaliana early flowering 3 (ELF3) as a zeitnehmer (time taker) is responsible for generation of circadian rhythm and regulation of photoperiodic flowering. There are two orthologs (OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2) of ELF3 in rice (Oryza sativa), but their roles have not yet been fully identified. Here, we performed a functional characterization of OsELF3-1 and revealed it plays a more predominant role than OsELF3-2 in rice heading. Our results suggest OsELF3-1 can affect rice circadian systems via positive regulation of OsLHY expression and negative regulation of OsPRR1, OsPRR37, OsPRR73 and OsPRR95 expression. In addition, OsELF3-1 is involved in blue light signaling by activating early heading date 1 (Ehd1) expression to promote rice flowering under short-day (SD) conditions. Moreover, OsELF3-1 suppresses a flowering repressor grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) to indirectly accelerate flowering under long-day (LD) conditions. Taken together, our results indicate OsELF3-1 is essential for circadian regulation and photoperiodic flowering in rice.
Mol. Plant-2011-Yan-319-30.pdf	A major QTL, Ghd8, plays pleiotropic roles in regulating grain productivity, plant height, and heading date in rice	2011	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Rice yield and heading date are two distinct traits controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying rice yield traits is important for developing high-yielding rice varieties. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Ghd8, a major QTL with pleiotropic effects on grain yield, heading date, and plant height. Two sets of near isogenic line populations were developed for the cloning of Ghd8. Ghd8 was narrowed down to a 20-kb region containing two putative genes, of which one encodes the OsHAP3 subunit of a CCAAT-box binding protein (HAP complex); this gene was regarded as the Ghd8 candidate. A complementary test confirmed the identity and pleiotropic effects of the gene; interestingly, the genetic effect of Ghd8 was dependent on its genetic background. By regulating Ehd1, RFT1, and Hd3a, Ghd8 delayed flowering under long-day conditions, but promoted flowering under short-day conditions. Ghd8 up-regulated MOC1, a key gene controlling tillering and branching; this increased the number of tillers, primary and secondary branches, thus producing 50% more grains per plant. The ectopic expression of Ghd8 in Arabidopsis caused early flowering by 10 d-a situation similar to the one observed by its homolog AtHAP3b, when compared to wild-type under long-day conditions; these findings indicate the conserved function of Ghd8 and AtHAP3b in flowering in Arabidopsis. Our results demonstrated the important roles of Ghd8 in rice yield formation and flowering, as well as its opposite functions in flowering between rice and Arabidopsis under long-day conditions.
ng.606.pdf	A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice	2010	Nat Genet	Photosynthesis and Photobiology Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Japan.	The critical day length triggering photoperiodic flowering is set as an acute, accurate threshold in many short-day plants, including rice. Here, we show that, unlike the Arabidopsis florigen gene FT, the rice florigen gene Hd3a (Heading date 3a) is toggled by only a 30-min day-length reduction. Hd3a expression is induced by Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) expression when blue light coincides with the morning phase set by OsGIGANTEA(OsGI)-dependent circadian clocks. Ehd1 expression is repressed by both night breaks under short-day conditions and morning light signals under long-day conditions. Ghd7 (Grain number, plant height and heading date 7) was acutely induced when phytochrome signals coincided with a photosensitive phase set differently by distinct photoperiods and this induction repressed Ehd1 the next morning. Thus, two distinct gating mechanisms--of the floral promoter Ehd1 and the floral repressor Ghd7--could enable manipulation of slight differences in day length to control Hd3a transcription with a critical day-length threshold.
Plant Cell Physiol-2011-Endo-Higashi-1083-94.pdf	Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice	2011	Plant Cell Physiol	University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.	Although flowering time is often associated with plant size, little is known about how flowering time genes affect plant architecture. We grew four rice lines having different flowering time genotypes (hd1 ehd1, hd1 Ehd1, Hd1 ehd1 and Hd1 Ehd1) under distinct photoperiod conditions. By using genotype-treatment combinations that resulted in similar flowering times, we were able to compare the effects of flowering time genes on traits related to plant architecture. The results revealed that the combination of Heading-date 1 (Hd1) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) can reduce the number of primary branches in a panicle, resulting in smaller spikelet numbers per panicle; this occurs independently of the control of flowering time. In addition, expression of the Hd3a and Rice Flowering-locus T 1 (RFT1) florigen genes was up-regulated in leaves of the Hd1 Ehd1 line at the time of the floral transition. We further revealed that Hd1 and/or Ehd1 caused up-regulation of Terminal Flower 1-like genes and precocious expression of panicle formation-related genes at shoot apical meristems during panicle development. Therefore, two key flowering time genes, Hd1 and Ehd1, can control panicle development in rice; this may affect crop yields in the field through florigen expression in leaf.

Although flowering regulatory mechanisms have been extensively studied in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), those in other species have not been well elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of OsMADS51, a type I MADS-box gene in the short-day (SD) promotion pathway in rice (Oryza sativa). In SDs OsMADS51 null mutants flowered 2 weeks later than normal, whereas in long days loss of OsMADS51 had little effect on flowering. Transcript levels of three flowering regulators-Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a-were decreased in these mutants, whereas those of OsGI and Hd1 were unchanged. Ectopic expression of OsMADS51 caused flowering to occur about 7 d earlier only in SDs. In ectopic expression lines, transcript levels of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a were increased, but those of OsGI and Hd1 remained the same. These results indicate that OsMADS51 is a flowering promoter, particularly in SDs, and that this gene functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a. To further investigate the relationship with other flowering promoters, we generated transgenic plants in which expression of Ehd1 or OsGI was suppressed. In Ehd1 RNA interference plants, OsMADS51 expression was not affected, supporting our conclusion that the MADS-box gene functions upstream of Ehd1. However, in OsGI antisense plants, the OsMADS51 transcript level was reduced. In addition, the circadian expression pattern for this MADS-box gene was similar to that for OsGI. These results demonstrate that OsMADS51 functions downstream of OsGI. In summary, OsMADS51 is a novel flowering promoter that transmits a SD promotion signal from OsGI to Ehd1.
Plant Physiol.-2008-Matsubara-1425-35.pdf	Ehd2, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating Ehd1	2008	Plant Physiol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Recent research into the flowering of rice (Oryza sativa) has revealed both unique and conserved genetic pathways in the photoperiodic control of flowering compared with those in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We discovered an early heading date2 (ehd2) mutant that shows extremely late flowering under both short- and long-day conditions in line with a background deficient in Heading date1 (Hd1), a rice CONSTANS ortholog that belongs to the conserved pathway. This phenotype in the ehd2 mutants suggests that Ehd2 is pivotal for the floral transition in rice. Map-based cloning revealed that Ehd2 encodes a putative transcription factor with zinc finger motifs orthologous to the INDETERMINATE1 (ID1) gene, which promotes flowering in maize (Zea mays). Ehd2 mRNA in rice tissues accumulated most abundantly in developing leaves, but was present at very low levels around the shoot apex and in roots, patterns that are similar to those of ID1. To assign the position of Ehd2 within the flowering pathway of rice, we compared transcript levels of previously isolated flowering-time genes, such as Ehd1, a member of the unique pathway, Hd3a, and Rice FT-like1 (RFT1; rice florigens), between the wild-type plants and the ehd2 mutants. Severely reduced expression of these genes in ehd2 under both short- and long-day conditions suggests that Ehd2 acts as a flowering promoter mainly by up-regulating Ehd1 and by up-regulating the downstream Hd3a and RFT1 genes in the unique genetic network of photoperiodic flowering in rice.
Plant Physiol.-2009-Andr-681-90.pdf	Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice	2009	Plant Physiol	Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias, Carretera Moncada-Naquera Km 7.5, 46113 Moncada, Spain.	A great number of plants synchronize flowering with day length. In rice (Oryza sativa), photoperiod is the primary environmental cue that triggers flowering. Here, we show that the s73 mutant, identified in a gamma-irradiated Bahia collection, displays early flowering and photoperiodic insensitivity due to a null mutation in the PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 (SE5) gene, which encodes an enzyme implicated in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis. s73 mutant plants show a number of alterations in the characteristic diurnal expression patterns of master genes involved in photoperiodic control of flowering, resulting in up-regulation of the floral integrator Heading date3a (Hd3a). Early heading date1 (Ehd1), an additional rice floral activator, was also highly expressed in the s73 mutant, suggesting that SE5 represses Ehd1 in wild-type plants. Silencing of Ehd1 in both Bahia and s73 backgrounds indicated that SE5 regulates Ehd1 expression. The data also indicate that SE5 confers photoperiodic sensitivity through regulation of Hd1. These results provide direct evidence that phytochromes inhibit flowering by affecting both Hd1 and Ehd1 flowering pathways.
Plant Physiol.-2010-Wei-pp.110.156943.pdf	DTH8 suppresses flowering in rice, influencing plant height and yield potential simultaneously	2010	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Provincial Center of Plant Gene Engineering, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	The three most important agronomic traits of rice (Oryza sativa), yield, plant height, and flowering time, are controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In this study, a newly identified QTL, DTH8 (QTL for days to heading on chromosome 8), was found to regulate these three traits in rice. Map-based cloning reveals that DTH8 encodes a putative HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor and the complementary experiment increased significantly days to heading, plant height, and number of grains per panicle in CSSL61 (a chromosome segment substitution line that carries the nonfunctional DTH8 allele) with the Asominori functional DTH8 allele under long-day conditions. DTH8 is expressed in most tissues and its protein is localized to the nucleus exclusively. The quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed that DTH8 could down-regulate the transcriptions of Ehd1 (for Early heading date1) and Hd3a (for Heading date3a; a rice ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T) under long-day conditions. Ehd1 and Hd3a can also be down-regulated by the photoperiodic flowering genes Ghd7 and Hd1 (a rice ortholog of CONSTANS). Meanwhile, the transcription of DTH8 has been proved to be independent of Ghd7 and Hd1, and the natural mutation of this gene caused weak photoperiod sensitivity and shorter plant height. Taken together, these data indicate that DTH8 probably plays an important role in the signal network of photoperiodic flowering as a novel suppressor as well as in the regulation of plant height and yield potential.
PNAS-2009-Takahashi-0812092106.pdf	Variations in Hd1 proteins, Hd3a promoters, and Ehd1 expression levels contribute to diversity of flowering time in cultivated rice	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara 630-0101, Japan.	Rice is a facultative short-day plant, and molecular genetic studies have identified the major genes involved in short-day flowering. However, the molecular mechanisms promoting the diversity of flowering time in cultivated rice are not known. We used a core collection of 64 rice cultivars that represent the genetic diversity of 332 accessions from around the world and studied the expression levels and polymorphisms of 6 genes in the short-day flowering pathway. The RNA levels of Heading date 3a (Hd3a), encoding a floral activator, are highly correlated with flowering time, and there is a high degree of polymorphism in the Heading date 1 (Hd1) protein, which is a major regulator of Hd3a expression. Functional and nonfunctional alleles of Hd1 are associated with early and late flowering, respectively, suggesting that Hd1 is a major determinant of variation in flowering time of cultivated rice. We also found that the type of Hd3a promoter and the level of Ehd1 expression contribute to the diversity in flowering time and Hd3a expression level. We evaluated the contributions of these 3 factors by a statistical analysis using a simple linear model, and the results supported our experimental observations.
tpj12057.pdf	OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice	2013	Plant J	Crop Biotech Institute, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, 446-701, Korea.	Flowering is exquisitely regulated by both promotive and inhibitory factors. Molecular genetic studies with Arabidopsis have verified several epigenetic repressors that regulate flowering time. However, the roles of chromatin remodeling factors in developmental processes have not been well explored in Oryza sativa (rice). We identified a chromatin remodeling factor OsVIL2 (O. sativa VIN3-LIKE 2) that promotes flowering. OsVIL2 contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which is a conserved motif of histone binding proteins. Insertion mutations in OsVIL2 caused late flowering under both long and short days. In osvil2 mutants OsLFL1 expression was increased, but that of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was reduced. We demonstrated that OsVIL2 is bound to native histone H3 in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that OsVIL2 was directly associated with OsLFL1 chromatin. We also observed that H3K27me3 was significantly enriched by OsLFL1 chromatin in the wild type, but that this enrichment was diminished in the osvil2 mutants. These results indicated that OsVIL2 epigenetically represses OsLFL1 expression. We showed that OsVIL2 physically interacts with OsEMF2b, a component of polycomb repression complex 2. As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression. Thus, we conclude that OsVIL2 functions together with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1.
tpj12268.pdf	Hd16, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response	2013	Plant J	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan.	The alteration of photoperiod sensitivity has let breeders diversify flowering time in Oryza sativa (rice) and develop cultivars adjusted to a range of growing season periods. Map-based cloning revealed that the rice flowering-time quantitative trait locus (QTL) Heading date 16 (Hd16) encodes a casein kinase-I protein. One non-synonymous substitution in Hd16 resulted in decreased photoperiod sensitivity in rice, and this substitution occurred naturally in an old rice cultivar. By using near-isogenic lines with functional or deficient alleles of several rice flowering-time genes, we observed significant digenetic interactions between Hd16 and four other flowering-time genes (Ghd7, Hd1, DTH8 and Hd2). In a near-isogenic line with the weak-photoperiod-sensitivity allele of Hd16, transcription levels of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 increased under long-day conditions, and transcription levels of Hd3a and RFT1 decreased under short-day conditions. Expression analysis under continuous light and dark conditions showed that Hd16 was not likely to be associated with circadian clock regulation. Biochemical characterization indicated that the functional Hd16 recombinant protein specifically phosphorylated Ghd7. These results demonstrate that Hd16 acts as an inhibitor in the rice flowering pathway by enhancing the photoperiod response as a result of the phosphorylation of Ghd7.
NA	Genetic interactions between diverged alleles of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) and Heading date 3a (Hd3a)/ RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (RFT1) control differential heading and contribute to regional adaptation in rice (Oryza sativa).	2015	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510642, China.	Initiation of flowering, also called heading, in rice (Oryza sativa) is determined by the florigens encoded by Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (RFT1). Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) regulates Hd3a and RFT1. However, different rice varieties have diverged alleles of Ehd1 and Hd3a/RFT1 and their genetic interactions remain largely unclear. Here we generated three segregating populations for different combinations of diverged Ehd1 and Hd3a/RFT1 alleles, and analyzed their genetic interactions between these alleles. We demonstrated that, in an ehd1 mutant background, Hd3a was silenced, but RFT1 was expressed (although at lower levels than in plants with a functional Ehd1) under short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions. We identified a nonfunctional RFT1 allele (rft1); the lines carrying homozygous ehd1 and Hd3a/rft1 failed to induce the floral transition under SD and LD conditions. Like Hd3a, RFT1 also interacted with 14-3-3 proteins, the florigen receptors, but a nonfunctional RFT1 with a crucial E105K mutation failed to interact with 14-3-3 proteins. Furthermore, analyses of sequence variation and geographic distribution suggested that functional RFT1 alleles were selected during rice adaptation to high-latitude regions. Our results demonstrate the important roles of RFT1 in rice flowering and regional adaptation.
NA	Both Hd1 and Ehd1 are important for artificial selection of flowering time in cultivated rice.	2015	Plant Sci	Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei 115, Taiwan; Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan. Electronic address: masker@gate.sinica.edu.tw.	Rice is a facultative short-day plant, and it requires a photoperiod shorter than the critical day length to get flowering. Sensitivity to photoperiod has been suggested as a major selection target in cultivated or weedy rice. The modern rice varieties in Taiwan may be cultivated twice a year. These varieties contain loss-of-function of two important flowering-time related genes, Heading date 1 (Hd1) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), and are mainly from a mega variety, Taichung 65. However, the parental lines of this variety were sensitive to photoperiod, thus, how Taichung 65 loss its sensitivity is a mystery. In this study, we used accession-specific single nucleotide polymorphism analysis to reveal the gene flow that occurred between different rice accessions decades ago and demonstrate that two landraces introgressed during the breeding process, which led to the loss of photoperiod sensitivity. Both Hd1 and Ehd1 may be important during artificial selection for flowering time, especially in a subtropical region such as Taiwan. This is a good example of introgression playing important roles during rice domestication.
NA	Nitrogen Mediates Flowering Time and Nitrogen Use Efficiency via Floral Regulators in Rice	2020	Curr Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	High nitrogen (N) fertilization for maximizing crop yield commonly leads to postponed flowering time (heading date in rice) and ripening, thus affecting resources use efficiency and followed planting time. We found that N-mediated heading date-1 (Nhd1) can directly activate florigen gene OsHd3a in rice. Inactivation of either Nhd1 or OsHd3a results in delay and insensitivity to N supply of flowering time. Knockout of Nhd1 increases N uptake and utilization efficiency at low-to-moderate N level under both short- and long-day field conditions. Increasing glutamine, the product of N assimilation, can upregulate expression of Nhd1, which in turn downregulates OsFd-GOGAT expression and OsFd-GOGAT activity, displaying a Nhd1-controlled negative feedback regulatory pathway of N assimilation. Moreover, N fertilization effect on rice flowering time shows genetically controlled diversity, and single-nucleotide polymorphism in Nhd1 promoter may relate to different responses of flowering time to N application. Nhd1 thus balances flowering time and N use efficiency in addition to photoperiod in rice.
NA	Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Rice is a facultative short day (SD) plant. In addition to serving as a model plant for molecular genetic studies of monocots, rice is a staple crop for about half of the world population. Heading date is a critical agronomic trait, and many genes controlling heading date have been cloned during the last two decades. The mechanism of flowering in rice from recognition of day length by leaves to floral activation in the shoot apical meristem has been extensively studied. In this review, we summarize current progress on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of heading date in rice with emphasis on post-translational modifications of key regulators, including Heading Date 1 (Hd1), Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Grain Number, Plant Height, and Heading Date7 (Ghd7). The contribution of heading date genes to heterosis and the expansion of rice cultivation areas from low-latitude to high-latitude regions are also discussed. To overcome limitations of diverse genetic backgrounds used in heading date studies and to gain a clearer understanding of flowering in rice, we propose a systematic collection of genetic resources in a common genetic background. Strategies in breeding adapted cultivars by rational design are also discussed.
NA	OsRRM, an RNA-Binding Protein, Modulates Sugar Transport in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	2020	Front Plant Sci	Jiangsu Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crops, Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding of Jiangsu Province, Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology of Jiangsu Province, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	Sugar allocation between vegetative and reproductive tissues is vital to plant development, and sugar transporters play fundamental roles in this process. Although several transcription factors have been identified that control their transcription levels, the way in which the expression of sugar transporter genes is controlled at the posttranscriptional level is unknown. In this study, we showed that OsRRM, an RNA-binding protein, modulates sugar allocation in tissues on the source-to-sink route. The OsRRM expression pattern partly resembles that of several sugar transporter and transcription factor genes that specifically affect sugar transporter gene expression. The messenger RNA levels of almost all of the sugar transporter genes are severely reduced in the osrrm mutant, and this alters sugar metabolism and sugar signaling, which further affects plant height, flowering time, seed size, and starch synthesis. We further showed that OsRRM binds directly to messenger RNAs encoded by sugar transporter genes and thus may stabilize their transcripts. Therefore, we have uncovered the physiological function of OsRRM, which sheds new light on sugar metabolism and sugar signaling.
