Programmed cell death (PCD) and immunity in plants are tightly controlled to promote antimicrobial defense while preventing autoimmunity. However, the mechanisms contributing to this immune homeostasis are poorly understood. Here, we isolated a rice mutant ebr1 (enhanced blight and blast resistance 1) that shows enhanced broad-spectrum bacterial and fungal disease resistance, but displays spontaneous PCD, autoimmunity, and stunted growth. EBR1 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with OsBAG4, which belongs to the BAG (Bcl-2-associated athanogene) family that functions in cell death, growth arrest, and immune responses in mammals. EBR1 directly targets OsBAG4 for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Elevated levels of OsBAG4 in rice are necessary and sufficient to trigger PCD and enhanced disease resistance to pathogenic infection, most likely by activating pathogen-associated molecular patterns-triggered immunity (PTI). Together, our study suggests that an E3-BAG module orchestrates innate immune homeostasis and coordinates the trade-off between defense and growth in plants.
