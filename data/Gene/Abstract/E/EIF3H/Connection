EIF3H	OseIF3e|EIF3E	Inhibition of a basal transcription factor 3-like gene Osj10gBTF3 in rice results in significant plant miniaturization and typical pollen abortion	Furthermore, the pollen that developed was completely sterile, which was correlated with the altered expression of two Rf (fertility restorer)-like genes that encode pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins OsPPR676 and OsPPR920, translational initiation factors OseIF3e and OseIF3h, and the heat shock protein OsHSP82
EIF3H	OseIF3f	The Rice Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit f (OseIF3f) Is Involved in Microgametogenesis.	Immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry confirmed that OseIF3f was a subunit of rice eIF3, which consisted of at least 12 subunits including eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3d, eIF3e, eIF3f, eIF3g, eIF3h, eIF3i, eIF3k, eIF3l, and eIF3m
AET1	EIF3H	Translational Regulation of Plant Response to High Temperature by a Dual Function tRNAHis Guanylyltransferase in Rice.	 Interestingly, AET1 possibly interacts with both RACK1A and eIF3h in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum)
