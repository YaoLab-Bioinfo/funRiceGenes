ONAC026|OsNAC26	nucleus	Three Rice NAC Transcription Factors Heteromerize and Are Associated with Seed Size.	Only ONAC026 is localized to the nucleus while ONAC020 and ONAC023 are targeted to the ER and cytoplasm, respectively
ONAC026|OsNAC26	nucleus	Three Rice NAC Transcription Factors Heteromerize and Are Associated with Seed Size.	Interestingly, these two proteins interact with ONAC026 and the dimers localize in the nucleus
