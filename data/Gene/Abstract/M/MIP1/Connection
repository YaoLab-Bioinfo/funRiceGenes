MOC1	OsHUB1|MIP1	Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1	In-depth characterization of the context of MIP1 and MOC1 would further our understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms of rice tillering
OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2|FRRP1	Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice	Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice
OSC4	OsHUB1|MIP1	Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice	Anther transcriptome analysis revealed that several key tapetum degradation-related genes including OsC4, OsCP1 and UDT1 were down-regulated in the mutants.

OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.
OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	Here, we show that SPIN6 interacts with OsHUB1 and OsHUB2, the homologous proteins of Arabidopsis RING finger E3 ligases HUB1 and HUB2
OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	OsHub1 and OsHub2 are down-regulated in the Spin6 RNAi plants and during the compatible interaction between rice and Magnaporthe oryzae
OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	OsHub1 and OsHub2 are induced by hormone treatments
OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	Like HUB1 and HUB2 in Arabidopsis, OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 in rice form homo- and hetero-dimers
OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 interact with SPIN6 and form homo- and hetero-dimers in rice.	Our results suggest that OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 may be associated with the SPIN6/OsRac1 pathway in rice immunity

OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 Here, we reported HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION 1 (OsHUB1) and OsHUB2 are involved in heading date regulation via the Hd1 and Ehd1 pathway
OsHUB1|MIP1	OsHUB2|FRRP1	OsHUB2 inhibits function of OsTrx1 in heading date in rice.	 Loss of OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 function resulted in early heading under long-day and short-day photoperiods
