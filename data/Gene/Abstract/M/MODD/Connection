MODD	OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	MODD mediates deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 to negatively regulate ABA signaling and drought resistance in rice.	MODD mediates deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 to negatively regulate ABA signaling and drought resistance in rice.
MODD	OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	MODD mediates deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 to negatively regulate ABA signaling and drought resistance in rice.	Here, we report an OsbZIP46-interacting protein, MODD (Mediator of OsbZIP46 deactivation and degradation), which is homologous to the Arabidopsis thaliana ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5)-binding protein AFP
MODD	OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	MODD mediates deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 to negatively regulate ABA signaling and drought resistance in rice.	MODD was induced by ABA and drought stress, but the induction was much slower than that of OsbZIP46
MODD	OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	MODD mediates deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 to negatively regulate ABA signaling and drought resistance in rice.	In contrast to OsbZIP46, MODD negatively regulates ABA signaling and drought tolerance, and inhibits the expression of OsbZIP46 target genes
MODD	OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	MODD mediates deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 to negatively regulate ABA signaling and drought resistance in rice.	We found that MODD negatively regulates OsbZIP46 activity and stability
MODD	OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	MODD mediates deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 to negatively regulate ABA signaling and drought resistance in rice.	MODD represses OsbZIP46 activity via interaction with the OsTPR3-HDA702 co-repressor complex and down-regulation of the histone acetylation level at OsbZIP46 target genes
MODD	OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	MODD mediates deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 to negatively regulate ABA signaling and drought resistance in rice.	MODD promotes OsbZIP46 degradation via interaction with the U-box type ubiquitin E3 ligase OsPUB70
MODD	OsAREB8|OsAREB1|OsbZIP46|OsABF2|ABL1	MODD mediates deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 to negatively regulate ABA signaling and drought resistance in rice.	Interestingly, the D domain is required for both deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 via its interaction with MODD
MODD	OsOTLD1	Reversible Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Fine-tunes Abscisic Acid Signaling and Drought Response in Rice.	 Interestingly, MODD, a reported suppressor of ABA signaling and drought resistance through mediation of OsbZIP46 deactivation and degradation, can repress the H2Bub1 level in the OsbZIP46 target genes by recruiting a putative deubiquitinase OsOTLD1
