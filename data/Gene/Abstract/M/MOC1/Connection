MOC1	OsHUB1|MIP1	Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1	Here we reported that MIP1 interacted with MOC1 both in vitro and in vivo
MOC1	OsHUB1|MIP1	Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1	In-depth characterization of the context of MIP1 and MOC1 would further our understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms of rice tillering
Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8|CAR8|OsNF-YB11	MOC1	A major QTL, Ghd8, plays pleiotropic roles in regulating grain productivity, plant height, and heading date in rice	Ghd8 up-regulated MOC1, a key gene controlling tillering and branching; this increased the number of tillers, primary and secondary branches, thus producing 50% more grains per plant
MOC1	OsCCS52A|TAD|TE	Rice APC/CTE controls tillering by mediating the degradation of MONOCULM 1	TE physically interacts with MOC1 and OsCDC27
FON1	MOC1	Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.	Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.
FON1	MOC1	Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.	 Here, we report that MONOCULM1 (MOC1) and MONOCULM 3/TILLERS ABSENT 1/STERILE AND REDUCED TILLERING 1 (MOC3/TAB1/SRT1), two vital regulators for tiller formation in rice, could physically interact to regulate tiller bud outgrowth through upregulating the expression of FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1), the homolog of CLAVATA1 in rice
FON1	MOC1	Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.	 MOC1 functions as a co-activator of MOC3, which did not directly bind to the FON1 promoter, but could further activate the FON1 expression in the presence of MOC3
FON1	MOC1	Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.	 Accordingly, FON1 is highly expressed at axillary meristems and shows remarkable decreased expression levels in moc1 and moc3 mutants

MOC1	MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.	 Collectively, these results shed lights on the joint transcriptional regulation by MOC1 and MOC3, and establish a new framework for the control of tiller bud formation and outgrowth

MOC1	SLR1|OsGAI	SLR1 inhibits MOC1 degradation to coordinate tiller number and plant height in rice.	 Here we show that rice tiller number regulator MONOCULM 1 (MOC1) is protected from degradation by binding to the DELLA protein SLENDER RICE 1 (SLR1)
MOC1	SLR1|OsGAI	SLR1 inhibits MOC1 degradation to coordinate tiller number and plant height in rice.	 GAs trigger the degradation of SLR1, leading to stem elongation and also to the degradation of MOC1, and hence a decrease in tiller number
MOC1	SLR1|OsGAI	SLR1 inhibits MOC1 degradation to coordinate tiller number and plant height in rice.	 This discovery provides a molecular explanation for the coordinated control of plant height and tiller number in rice by GAs, SLR1 and MOC1
