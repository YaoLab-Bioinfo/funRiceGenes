As one of the largest gene families, F-box domain proteins have important roles in regulating various developmental processes and stress responses. In this study, we have investigated a rice F-box domain gene, MAIF1. The MAIF1 protein is mainly localized in the plasma membrane and nucleus. MAIF1 expression is induced rapidly and strongly by abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stresses. MAIF1 expression is also induced in root tips by sucrose, independent of its hydrolytic hexose products, glucose and fructose, and the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin. Overexpression of MAIF1 reduces rice ABA sensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance and promotes rice root growth. These results suggest that MAIF1 is involved in multiple signaling pathways in regulating root growth. Growth restraint in plants is an acclimatization strategy against abiotic stress. Our results also suggest that MAIF1 plays the negative role in response to abiotic stress possibly by regulating root growth.
