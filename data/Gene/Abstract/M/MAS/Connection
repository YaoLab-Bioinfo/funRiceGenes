CYP99A2	MAS|OsMAS	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice	The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment
CYP99A3	MAS|OsMAS	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice	The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment
MAS|OsMAS	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice	The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment
MAS|OsMAS	OsCPS4|OsCyc1	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice	The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment

BPH9	MAS|OsMAS	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	Here, we developed near isogenic lines of Bph9 (NIL-Bph9) by backcrossing elite cultivar 93-11 with Pokkali (harboring Bph9) using marker-assisted selection (MAS)
BPH9	MAS|OsMAS	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	 Subsequently, we pyramided Bph6 and Bph9 in 93-11 genetic background through MAS
BPH9	MAS|OsMAS	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	 The development of functional markers will promote MAS of Bph9
