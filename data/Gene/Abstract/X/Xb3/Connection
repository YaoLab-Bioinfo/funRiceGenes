xa21	Xb3	Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance	We identified XA21 binding protein 3 (XB3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a substrate for the XA21 Ser and Thr kinase
xa21	Xb3	Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance	The interaction between XB3 and the kinase domain of XA21 has been shown in yeast and in vitro, and the physical association between XB3 and XA21 in vivo has also been confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays
xa21	Xb3	Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance	XB3 contains an ankyrin repeat domain and a RING finger motif that is sufficient for its interaction with the kinase domain of XA21 and for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, respectively
xa21	Xb3	Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance	Furthermore, reduced levels of Xb3 lead to decreased levels of the XA21 protein
xa21	Xb3	Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance	These results indicate that Xb3 is necessary for full accumulation of the XA21 protein and for Xa21-mediated resistance
OsSERK2	Xb3	Four tyrosine residues of the rice immune receptor XA21 are not required for interaction with the co-receptor OsSERK2 or resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	 Four of the XA21JKYF variants maintain interaction with OsSERK2 as well as the XA21 binding (XB) proteins XB3 and XB15 in yeast, suggesting that these four tyrosine residues are not required for their interaction
