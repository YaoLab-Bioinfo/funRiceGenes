Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is one of the most serious diseases of rice worldwide. Thirty bacterial blight resistance (R) genes (21 dominant genes and 9 recessive genes) in rice have been identified. They are the main sources for the genetic improvement of rice for resistance to Xoo. However, little is known about the recessive R genes. To clone and characterize the recessive R genes, we fine-mapped xa13, a fully recessive gene for Xoo resistance, to a DNA fragment of 14.8 kb using the map-based cloning strategy and a series of sequence-based molecular markers. Sequence analysis of this fragment indicated that this region contains only two apparently intact candidate genes (an extensin-like gene and a homologue of nodulin MtN3) and the 5' end of a predicted hypothetical gene. These results will greatly facilitate the isolation and characterization of xa13. Four PCR-based markers, E6a, SR6, ST9 and SR11 that were tightly linked to the xa13 locus, were also developed. These markers will be useful tools for the marker-assisted selection of xa13 in breeding programs.
10.1007-s001220051163.pdf	Genetic and physical mapping of xa13 , a recessive bacterial blight resistance gene in rice	1999	TAG Theoretical and Applied Genetics	Plant Breeding, Genetics and Biochemistry Division, International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), P.O. Box 933, 1099 Manila, The Philippines 	The recessive gene, xa13, confers resistance to Philippine race 6 (PXO99) of the bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. Fine genetic mapping and physical mapping were conducted as initial steps in an effort to isolate the gene. Using nine selected DNA markers and two F2 populations of 132 and 230 plants, xa13 was fine-mapped to a genomic region <4éˆ¥åŒM on the long arm of rice chromosome 8, flanked by two RFLP markers, RG136 and R2027. Four DNA markers, RG136, R2027, S14003, and G1149, in the target region were used to identify bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones potentially harboring the xa13 locus from a rice BAC library. A total of 11 BACs were identified, forming four separate contigs including a single-clone contig, 29I3, associated with the RG136 STS marker, the S14003 contig consisting of four clones (44F8, 41O2, 12A16, and 12F20), the G1149 contig with two clones, 23D11 and 21H18, and the R2027 contig consisting of four overlapping clones, 42C23, 30B5, 6B7 and 21H14. Genetic mapping indicated that the xa13 locus was contained in the R2027 contig. Chromosomal walking on the R2027 contig resulted in two more clones, 33C7 and 14L3. DNA fingerprinting showed that the six clones of the R2027 contig were overlapping. Clone 44F8 hybridized with a single fragment from the clone 14L3, integrating the R2027 and S14003 contigs into a single contig consisting of ten BAC clones with a total size of approximately 330 kb. The physical presence of the xa13 locus in the contig was determined by mapping the ends of the BAC inserts generated by TAIL-PCR. In an F2 population of 230 plants, the BAC-end markers 42C23R and 6B7F flanked the xa13 locus. The probes 21H14F and 21H14R derived from BAC clone 21H14 were found to flank xa13 at a distance of 0.5 cM on either side, using a second F2 population of 132 plants. Thus, genetic mapping indicated that the contig and the 96-kb clone, 21H14, contained the xa13 locus.
10.1007-s00299-011-1206-8.pdf	Gene silencing using the recessive rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa13 as a new paradigm in plant breeding	2012	Plant Cell Rep	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Centre of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Resistant germplasm resources are valuable for developing resistant varieties in agricultural production. However, recessive resistance genes are usually overlooked in hybrid breeding. Compared with dominant traits, however, they may confer resistance to different pathogenic races or pest biotypes with different mechanisms of action. The recessive rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa13, also involved in pollen development, has been cloned and its resistance mechanism has been recently characterized. This report describes the conversion of bacterial blight resistance mediated by the recessive xa13 gene into a dominant trait to facilitate its use in a breeding program. This was achieved by knockdown of the corresponding dominant allele Xa13 in transgenic rice using recently developed artificial microRNA technology. Tissue-specific promoters were used to exclude most of the expression of artificial microRNA in the anther to ensure that Xa13 functioned normally during pollen development. A battery of highly bacterial blight resistant transgenic plants with normal seed setting rates were acquired, indicating that highly specific gene silencing had been achieved. Our success with xa13 provides a paradigm that can be adapted to other recessive resistance genes.
1250.pdf	Promoter mutations of an essential gene for pollen development result in disease resistance in rice	2006	Genes Dev	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Disease resistance and sexual reproductive development are generally considered as separate biological processes, regulated by different sets of genes. Here we show that xa13, a recessive allele conferring disease resistance against bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide, plays a key role in both disease resistance and pollen development. The dominant allele, Xa13, is required for both bacterial growth and pollen development. Promoter mutations in Xa13 cause down-regulation of expression during host-pathogen interaction, resulting in the fully recessive xa13 that confers race-specific resistance. The recessive xa13 allele represents a new type of plant disease resistance.
nph4367.pdf	Transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors targeting OsSWEET genes enhance virulence on diverse rice (Oryza sativa) varieties when expressed individually in a TAL effector-deficient strain of Xanthomonas oryzae	2012	New Phytol	Department of Bioagricultural Sciences and Pest Management, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1177, USA.	Genomes of the rice (Oryza sativa) xylem and mesophyll pathogens Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and pv. oryzicola (Xoc) encode numerous secreted transcription factors called transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors. In a few studied rice varieties, some of these contribute to virulence by activating corresponding host susceptibility genes. Some activate disease resistance genes. The roles of X. oryzae TAL effectors in diverse rice backgrounds, however, are poorly understood. Xoo TAL effectors that promote infection by activating SWEET sucrose transporter genes were expressed in TAL effector-deficient X. oryzae strain X11-5A, and assessed in 21 rice varieties. Some were also tested in Xoc on variety Nipponbare. Several Xoc TAL effectors were tested in X11-5A on four rice varieties. Xoo TAL effectors enhanced X11-5A virulence on most varieties, but to varying extents depending on the effector and variety. SWEET genes were activated in all tested varieties, but increased virulence did not correlate with activation level. SWEET activators also enhanced Xoc virulence on Nipponbare. Xoc TAL effectors did not alter X11-5A virulence. SWEET-targeting TAL effectors contribute broadly and non-tissue-specifically to virulence in rice, and their function is affected by host differences besides target sequences. Further, the utility of X11-5A for characterizing individual TAL effectors in rice was established.
Plant Cell-2010-Antony-3864-76.pdf	Rice xa13 recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3	2010	Plant Cell	Department of Plant Pathology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas 66506, USA.	The rice (Oryza sativa) gene xa13 is a recessive resistance allele of Os-8N3, a member of the NODULIN3 (N3) gene family, located on rice chromosome 8. Os-8N3 is a susceptibility (S) gene for Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight, and the recessive allele is defeated by strains of the pathogen producing any one of the type III effectors AvrXa7, PthXo2, or PthXo3, which are all members of the transcription activator-like (TAL) effector family. Both AvrXa7 and PthXo3 induce the expression of a second member of the N3 gene family, here named Os-11N3. Insertional mutagenesis or RNA-mediated silencing of Os-11N3 resulted in plants with loss of susceptibility specifically to strains of X. oryzae pv oryzae dependent on AvrXa7 or PthXo3 for virulence. We further show that AvrXa7 drives expression of Os-11N3 and that AvrXa7 interacts and binds specifically to an effector binding element within the Os-11N3 promoter, lending support to the predictive models for TAL effector binding specificity. The result indicates that variations in the TAL effector repetitive domains are driven by selection to overcome both dominant and recessive forms of resistance to bacterial blight in rice. The finding that Os-8N3 and Os-11N3 encode closely related proteins also provides evidence that N3 proteins have a specific function in facilitating bacterial blight disease.
PNAS-2006-Yang-10503-8.pdf	Os8N3 is a host disease-susceptibility gene for bacterial blight of rice	2006	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Plant Pathology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.	Many bacterial diseases of plants depend on the interaction of type III effector genes of the pathogen and disease-susceptibility genes of the host. The host susceptibility genes are largely unknown. Here, we show that expression of the rice gene Os8N3, a member of the MtN3 gene family from plants and animals, is elevated upon infection by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99(A) and depends on the type III effector gene pthXo1. Os8N3 resides near xa13, and PXO99(A) failed to induce Os8N3 in rice lines with xa13. Silencing of Os8N3 by inhibitory RNA produced plants that were resistant to infection by strain PXO99(A) yet remained susceptible to other strains of the pathogen. The effector gene avrXa7 from strain PXO86 enabled PXO99(A) compatibility on either xa13- or Os8N3-silenced plants. The findings indicate that Os8N3 is a host susceptibility gene for bacterial blight targeted by the type III effector PthXo1. The results support the hypothesis that X. oryzae pv. oryzae commandeers the regulation of otherwise developmentally regulated host genes to induce a state of disease susceptibility. Furthermore, the results support a model in which the pathogen induces disease susceptibility in a gene-for-gene manner.
Yuan_Ting_MP_2011.pdf	Characterization of Xanthomonas oryzae-responsive cis-acting element in the promoter of rice race-specific susceptibility gene Xa13	2011	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The rice Xa13 gene, whose promoter harbors a UPT (up-regulated by transcription activator-like [TAL] effector) box, UPT(PthXo1), plays a pivotal role in the race-specific pathogenicity caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) strain PXO99. PXO99 causes rice disease by inducing Xa13. It is unknown, however, whether the UPT(PthXo1) box is the only PXO99-responsive cis-regulating elements in the activation of Xa13 expression. We analyzed the expression of a series of end- and site-truncated and site-mutated Xa13 promoters in rice and the binding of PXO99 protein to the intact, partial, or site-mutated UPT(PthXo1) boxes. In the Xa13 promoter, UPT(PthXo1) box is the only Xoo-responsive cis-acting element that results in PXO99-induced Xa13 expression. The 5'-terminal second, third, and fourth nucleotides of the box are important for bacterial protein binding and gene activation; mutation of any one of these sites abolished PXO99-induced gene expression. Furthermore, the 3'-half of the UPT(PthXo1) box is also required for protein binding and gene activation. These findings will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the interaction of rice and Xoo via UPT boxes and TAL effectors.
PDIS%2E2001%2E85%2E5%2E506.pdf	Identification of Resistance Genes Effective Against Rice Bacterial Blight Pathogen in Eastern India	2001	Plant Disease	Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI), Cuttack 753 006, India	Breeding for bacterial blight resistance in rice requires an understanding of the contemporary pathogen populations in the locations where resistance genes are to be deployed. We characterized 450 strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae collected from three states of India using polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting and virulence analysis. This pathogen collection was differentiated into 17 haplotypes (12 lineages at 80% similarity level). Significant differences in the distribution of haplotypes were observed among regions. Virulence analysis of the pathogen collection revealed nine pathotypes. Among the populations from three regions, the Orissa population was the most diverse, consisting of 11 out of 17 haplotypes and five out of nine pathotypes detected in the total collection. Representative pathotypes were used to evaluate seven near-isogenic lines carrying individual bacterial blight resistance genes (Xa3, Xa4, xa5, Xa7, Xa10, xa13, and Xa21) and gene pyramids. Pathogen strains compatible to individual genes were present in detectable frequencies, although no single strain could overcome all resistance genes. Gene combinations Xa4 + xa5, xa5 + Xa21, and Xa4 + xa5 + Xa21 conferred a broad spectrum of resistance to all the strains evaluated, supporting the strategy of pyramiding appropriate resistance genes.
NA	Essential Role of Sugar Transporter OsSWEET11 during the Early Stage of Rice Grain Filling.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	College of Resources &amp; Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095 China.	This study investigated the role of sugar transporter OsSWEET11 during the early stage of rice caryopsis development using the Î²-glucoronidase (GUS)-represented expression, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout, cross-fertilization, and RNA-seq analyses. Results showed that OsSWEET11 was expressed strongly in developing caryopsis, particularly in the ovular vascular trace, nucellar epidermis, and cross cells. The knockout of OsSWEET11 significantly decreased sucrose concentration in the mutant embryo-sacs and led to defective grain filling compared with that of the wild-type (WT) plant. Moreover, the expression of 2549 genes in the mutant caryopsis was affected. The grain weight, seed setting percentage were also decreased in the mutants. The cross-fertilization of the mutant and WT rice revealed that the mutated maternal donor induced defective grain filling. These results strongly suggested that OsSWEET11 played an important role in sucrose release from maternal tissue to the maternal-filial interface during the early stage of caryopsis development. It might also induce sucrose release from the ovular vascular trace and cross cells of developing caryopsis. These findings bridge the gap in the understanding of post phloem sugar transport during the early stage of rice caryopsis development.
NA	SWEET11 and 15 as key players in seed filling in rice.	2018	New Phytol	Institute for Molecular Physiology, Heinrich-Heine University Duesseldorf, 40225, Duesseldorf, Germany.	Despite the relevance of seed-filling mechanisms for crop yield, we still have only a rudimentary understanding of the transport processes that supply the caryopsis with sugars. We hypothesized that SWEET sucrose transporters may play important roles in nutrient import pathways in the rice caryopsis. We used a combination of mRNA quantification, histochemical analyses, translational promoter-reporter fusions and analysis of knockout mutants created by genomic editing to evaluate the contribution of SWEET transporters to seed filling. In rice caryopses, SWEET11 and 15 had the highest mRNA levels and proteins localized to four key sites: all regions of the nucellus at early stages; the nucellar projection close to the dorsal vein; the nucellar epidermis that surrounds the endosperm; and the aleurone. ossweet11;15 double knockout lines accumulated starch in the pericarp, whereas caryopses did not contain a functional endosperm. Jointly, SWEET11 and 15 show all the hallmarks of being necessary for seed filling with sucrose efflux functions at the nucellar projection and a role in transfer across the nucellar epidermis/aleurone interface, delineating two major steps for apoplasmic seed filling, observations that are discussed in relation to observations made in rice and barley regarding the relative prevalence of these two potential import routes.
NA	Inhibition of OsSWEET11 function in mesophyll cells improves resistance of rice to sheath blight disease.	2018	Mol Plant Pathol	College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Dongling Road 120, Shenyang 110866, China.	Pathogen-host interaction is a complicated process; pathogens mainly infect host plants to acquire nutrients, especially sugars. Rhizoctonia solani, the causative agent of sheath blight disease, is a major pathogen of rice. However, it is not known, as to how this pathogen obtains sugar from rice plants. In this study, we found that the rice sugar transporter, OsSWEET11 is involved in the pathogenesis of sheath blight disease. qRT-PCR and ¦Â-d-glucuronidase expression analyses showed that R. solani infection significantly enhanced OsSWEET11 expression in leaves among the clade III SWEET members. The analyses of transgenic plants revealed that Ossweet11 mutants were less susceptible, whereas plants overexpressing OsSWEET11 were more susceptible to sheath blight compared to wild-type controls, but the yield of OsSWEET11 mutants and overexpressors was reduced. SWEETs become active upon oligomerization. Split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that mutated-OsSWEET11 interacted with normal OsSWEET11. In addition, expressing conserved residue mutated-AtSWEET1 inhibits normal AtSWEET1 activity. To analyze whether inhibition of OsSWEET11 function in mesophyll cells is related to defense against this disease, mutated- OsSWEET11 was expressed under the control of Rubisco promoter, which is specific for green tissues. The resistance of transgenic plants to sheath blight disease, but not other disease was improved, while yield production was not evidently affected. Overall, these results suggest that R. solani might acquire sugar from rice leaves by activating OsSWEET11 expression. The plants can be protected from infection by manipulating the expression of OsSWEET11 without affecting the crop yield. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
