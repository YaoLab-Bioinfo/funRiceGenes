xa21	XB15|PP2C	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity	A yeast two-hybrid screen using the intracellular portion of XA21, including the juxtamembrane (JM) and kinase domain as bait, identified a protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), called XA21 binding protein 15 (XB15)
xa21	XB15|PP2C	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity	The interaction of XA21 and XB15 was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively
xa21	XB15|PP2C	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity	Autophosphorylated XA21 can be dephosphorylated by XB15 in a temporal- and dosage-dependent manner
xa21	XB15|PP2C	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity	A serine residue in the XA21 JM domain is required for XB15 binding
xa21	XB15|PP2C	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity	Xb15 mutants display a severe cell death phenotype, induction of pathogenesis-related genes, and enhanced XA21-mediated resistance
xa21	XB15|PP2C	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity	Overexpression of Xb15 in an XA21 rice line compromises resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv
xa21	XB15|PP2C	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity	These results demonstrate that Xb15 encodes a PP2C that negatively regulates the XA21-mediated innate immune response
xa21	XB15|PP2C	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity	Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity
OsSIPP2C1|OsPP2C68|OsPP108	XB15|PP2C	ABA inducible rice protein phosphatase 2C confers ABA insensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.	We have identified a group A PP2C from rice (OsPP108), which is highly inducible under ABA, salt and drought stresses and localized predominantly in the nucleus
OsBIERF1|OsPP2C34	XB15|PP2C	Isolation of a novel protein phosphatase2C in rice and its response to gibberellin.	 Here, we identified a novel PP2C from rice (OsPP2C34), which is highly inducible by gibberellin (GA) and expressed in various tissues
SERK2|OsSERK2	XB15|PP2C	Four tyrosine residues of the rice immune receptor XA21 are not required for interaction with the co-receptor OsSERK2 or resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	 Four of the XA21JKYF variants maintain interaction with OsSERK2 as well as the XA21 binding (XB) proteins XB3 and XB15 in yeast, suggesting that these four tyrosine residues are not required for their interaction
OsPP2C09|OsPP15|OsPYL2	XB15|PP2C	OsPP2C09, a negative regulatory factor in abscisic acid signaling, plays an essential role in balancing plant growth and drought tolerance in rice.	 The OsPP2C09 protein interacted with the core components of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and showed PP2C phosphatase activity in vitro
OsPP95	XB15|PP2C	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE95 Regulates Phosphate Homeostasis by Affecting Phosphate Transporter Trafficking in Rice[OPEN]	 We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) protein phosphatase OsPP95 interacts with OsPT2 and OsPT8 and dephosphorylates OsPT8 at Ser-517
OsPht1;2|OsPT2	XB15|PP2C	PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE95 Regulates Phosphate Homeostasis by Affecting Phosphate Transporter Trafficking in Rice[OPEN]	 We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) protein phosphatase OsPP95 interacts with OsPT2 and OsPT8 and dephosphorylates OsPT8 at Ser-517
