Xa3-mediated resistance for rice bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide, is influenced by genetic background. Xa3 is genetically tightly linked to Xa26, another gene for bacterial blight resistance. Xa26 belongs to a clustered multigene family encoding leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-like proteins. To characterize Xa3, we fine mapped it using a population segregating for only one resistance gene and markers developed from Xa26 family. Genetic analysis showed that Xa3 co-segregated with the marker of Xa26 gene and segregated from the markers of other members of Xa26 family. DNA fingerprinting revealed that rice line IRBB3 carrying Xa3 had the same copy numbers of Xa26 family members as rice line Minghui 63 carrying Xa26. Phenotypic comparison showed that all the rice lines carrying either Xa3 or Xa26 developed dark brown deposition at the border between the lesion caused by incompatible-pathogen infection and health leaf tissue, while other rice lines did not show this dark brown deposition in either incompatible or compatible interactions. These results suggest that Xa3 and Xa26 is the same gene. We name it Xa3/Xa26 to indicate the relationship between the two gene symbols. The putative encoding products of Xa3/Xa26 and its susceptible allele xa3/xa26 shared 92% sequence identity. The sequence difference occurred in the LRR domains, specifically at the solvent-exposed amino acid residues, might be the major cause that differentiates the resistant and susceptible proteins.
1471-2229-11-160.pdf	A pair of orthologs of a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-like disease resistance gene family regulates rice response to raised temperature	2011	BMC Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	BACKGROUND: Rice Xa3/Xa26 disease-resistance gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-type protein against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and belongs to a multigene family. However, the functions of most genes in this family are unknown. RESULTS: Here we report that two orthologs of this family, the NRKe from rice variety Nipponbare and 9RKe from variety 93-11 at the RKe locus, have similar functions although they encode different proteins. This pair of orthologs could not mediate resistance to Xoo, but they were transcriptionally induced by raised temperature. Transcriptional activation of NRKe or 9RKe resulted in the formation of temperature-sensitive lesion mimics, which were spots of dead cells associated with accumulation of superoxides, in different organs of the transgenic plants. These plants were more sensitive to high temperature shock than wild-type controls. Transgenic plants carrying a chimeric protein consisting of the LRR domain of NRKe and the kinase domain of Xa3/Xa26 developed the same lesion mimics as the NRKe-transgenic plants, whereas transgenic plants carrying another chimeric protein consisting of the LRR domain of Xa3/Xa26 and the kinase domain of NRKe were free of lesion mimic. All the transgenic plants carrying a chimeric protein were susceptible to Xoo. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the RKe locus is involved in rice response to raised temperature. The LRR domain of RKe protein appears to be important to sense increased temperature. The RKe-involved temperature-related pathway and Xa3/Xa26-mediated disease-resistance pathway may partially overlap.
523.full.pdf	The expression pattern of a rice disease resistance gene xa3/xa26 is differentially regulated by the genetic backgrounds and developmental stages that influence its function	2007	Genetics	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Genetic background and developmental stage influence the function of some disease resistance (R) genes. The molecular mechanisms of these modifications remain elusive. Our results show that the two factors are associated with the expression of the R gene in rice Xa3 (also known as Xa26)-mediated resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which in turn influences the expression of defense-responsive genes. The background of japonica rice, one of the two major subspecies of Asian cultivated rice, facilitates the function of Xa3 more than the background of indica rice, another rice subspecies. Xa3 expression gradually increases from early seedling stage to adult stage. Japonica plants carrying Xa3 regulated by the native promoter showed an enlarged resistance spectrum (i.e., resistance to more Xoo races), an increased resistance level (i.e., further reduced lesion length), and whole-growth-stage resistance compared to the indica rice; this enhanced resistance was associated with an increased expression of Xa3 throughout the growth stages in the japonica plants, which resulted in enhanced expression of defense-responsive genes. Overexpressing Xa3 with a constitutive strong promoter further enhanced rice resistance due to further increased Xa3 transcripts in both indica and japonica backgrounds, whereas regulating Xa3 with a pathogen-induced weak promoter impaired rice resistance.
CYL_TAG_2007.pdf	Functional analysis of Xa3/Xa26 family members in rice resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	2007	Theor Appl Genet	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Plant disease resistant (R) genes are frequently clustered in the genome. The diversity of members in a complex R-gene family may provide variation in resistance specificity. Rice Xa3/Xa26, conferring resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-type protein and belongs to a multigene family, consisting of Xa3/Xa26, MRKa, MRKc and MRKd in rice cultivar Minghui 63. MRKa and MRKc are intact genes, while MRKd is a pseudogene. Complementary analyses showed that MRKa and MRKc could not mediate resistance to Xoo when regulated by their native promoters, but MRKa not MRKc conferred partial resistance to Xoo when regulated by a strong constitutive promoter. Plants carrying truncated XA3/XA26, which lacked the kinase domain, were compromised in their resistance to Xoo. However, the kinase domain of MRKa could partially restore the function of the truncated XA3/XA26 in resistance. MRKa and MRKc showed similar expression pattern as Xa3/Xa26, which expressed only in the vascular systems of different tissues. The expressional characteristic of MRKa and MRKc perfectly fits the function of genes conferring resistance to Xoo, a vascular pathogen. These results suggest that although MRKa and MRKc cannot mediate bacterial blight resistance nowadays, they may be once effective genes for Xoo resistance. Their expressional characteristic and sequence similarity to Xa3/Xa26 will provide templates for generating novel recognition specificity to face the evolution of Xoo. In addition, both LRR and kinase domains encoded by Xa3/Xa26 and MRKa are the functional determinants and MRKa-mediated resistance is dosage-dependent.
Mol. Plant-2014-Chen-mp-ssu003.pdf	An XA21-associated kinase (OsSERK2) regulates immunity mediated by the XA21 and XA3 immune receptors	2014	Mol Plant	Department of Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.	The rice XA21 immune receptor kinase and the structurally related XA3 receptor confer immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight. Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2). Rice plants silenced for OsSerk2 display altered morphology and reduced sensitivity to the hormone brassinolide. OsSERK2 interacts with the intracellular domains of each immune receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system in a kinase activity-dependent manner. OsSERK2 undergoes bidirectional transphosphorylation with XA21 in vitro and forms a constitutive complex with XA21 in vivo. These results demonstrate an essential role for OsSERK2 in the function of three rice immune receptors and suggest that direct interaction with the rice immune receptors is critical for their function. Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR.
ssr079.pdf	Ortholog alleles at Xa3/Xa26 locus confer conserved race-specific resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae in rice	2012	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The rice disease resistance (R) gene Xa3/Xa26 (having also been named Xa3 and Xa26) against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight disease, belongs to a multiple gene family clustered in chromosome 11 and is from an AA genome rice cultivar (Oryza sativa L.). This family encodes leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-type proteins. Here, we show that the orthologs (alleles) of Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, and Xa3/Xa26-3, from wild Oryza species O. officinalis (CC genome) and O. minuta (BBCC genome), respectively, were also R genes against Xoo. Xa3/Xa26-2 and Xa3/Xa26-3 conferred resistance to 16 of the 18 Xoo strains examined. Comparative sequence analysis of the Xa3/Xa26 families in the two wild Oryza species showed that Xa3/Xa26-3 appeared to have originated from the CC genome of O. minuta. The predicted proteins encoded by Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, and Xa3/Xa26-3 share 91-99% sequence identity and 94-99% sequence similarity. Transgenic plants carrying a single copy of Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, or Xa3/Xa26-3, in the same genetic background, showed a similar resistance spectrum to a set of Xoo strains, although plants carrying Xa3/Xa26-2 or Xa3/Xa26-3 showed lower resistance levels than the plants carrying Xa3/Xa26. These results suggest that the Xa3/Xa26 locus predates the speciation of A and C genome, which is approximately 7.5 million years ago. Thus, the resistance specificity of this locus has been conserved for a long time.
Sun XL et al Plant J.pdf	Xa26, a gene conferring resistance toXanthomonas oryzaepv.oryzaein rice, encodes an LRR receptor kinase-like protein	2004	The Plant Journal	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Crop Molecular Breeding, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Rice bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is one of the most serious rice diseases worldwide. A rice gene, Xa26, conferring resistance against Xoo at both seedling and adult stages was isolated by map-based cloning strategies from the rice cultivar Minghui 63. Xa26 belongs to a multigene family consisting of four members. It encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-like protein and is constitutively expressed. Sequence analysis revealed that IRBB3 and Zhachanglong lines that are resistant to a broad range of Xoo strains, also carry Xa26. However, significant difference in lesion length was observed among these lines after inoculation with a set of Xoo strains. Moreover, transgenic plants carrying Xa26 showed enhanced resistance compared with the donor line of the gene in both seedling and adult stages. These results suggest that the resistance conferred by Xa26 is influenced by the genetic background.
ZhouY_TAG_2009.pdf	Multiple gene loci affecting genetic background-controlled disease resistance conferred by R gene Xa3/Xa26 in rice	2009	Theor Appl Genet	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, 430070, Wuhan, China.	The function of bacterial-blight resistance gene Xa3/Xa26 in rice is influenced by genetic background; the Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica background can increase Xa3/Xa26 expression, resulting in an enhanced resistance. To identify whether Xa3/Xa26 transcript level is the only factor contributing to genetic background-controlled resistance, we screened an F(2) population that was developed from a cross between Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica and japonica rice lines and was segregating for Xa3/Xa26, and compared the expression profiles of a pair of indica and japonica rice lines that both carried Xa3/Xa26. Eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs), in addition to Xa3/Xa26, were identified as contributing to the bacterial resistance of this population. Four of the eight QTLs were contributed to the japonica line. The resistance of this population was also affected by epistatic effects. Some F(2) individuals showed significantly increased Xa3/Xa26 transcripts, but the increased transcripts did not completely correlate with the reduced disease in this population. The analysis of the expression profile of Xa3/Xa26-mediated resistance using a microarray containing approximate 7,990 rice genes identified 44 differentially expressed genes. Thirty-five genes were rapidly activated in the japonica background, but not in the indica background, during disease resistance. These results suggest that multiple factors, including the one resulting in increased Xa3/Xa26 expression, may contribute to the enhanced resistance in the japonica background. These factors can cause a variation in gene expression profile that differs from that in the indica background during disease resistance.

The inheritance of resistance for bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo), was studied in Minghui 63, an elite restorer line for a number of widely used rice hybrids in China. A new dominant gene against a Chinese Xoo strain JL691 in both the seedling and adult stages was identified in Minghui 63 and designated as Xa26( t). Using a total of 477 highly susceptible individuals from an F(2) population, the Xa26( t) locus was mapped to a region of about 1.68 cM. This locus co-segregated with marker R1506 and was 0.21 cM from marker RM224 on one side and 1.47 cM from marker Y6855RA on the other side, in rice chromosome 11. A contig map, composed of five non-redundant bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and spanning approximately 500 kb in length, was constructed. Analysis of recombination events in the Xa26( t) region with the highly susceptible F(2) individuals anchored the gene locus to a region covered by three overlapped BAC clones. Assay of the lines showing a double crossover in marker loci flanking Xa26( t), in a population of recombinant inbred lines carrying Xa26( t), further delineated the gene to a 20-kb fragment. The Xa26( t) locus is tightly linked to another bacterial blight resistance gene locus, Xa4.
NA	Small RNAs and Gene Network in a Durable Disease Resistance Gene-Mediated Defense Responses in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Accumulating data have suggested that small RNAs (sRNAs) have important functions in plant responses to pathogen invasion. However, it is largely unknown whether and how sRNAs are involved in the regulation of rice responses to the invasion of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight, the most devastating bacterial disease of rice worldwide. We performed simultaneous genome-wide analyses of the expression of sRNAs and genes during early defense responses of rice to Xoo mediated by a major disease resistance gene, Xa3/Xa26, which confers durable and race-specific qualitative resistance. A large number of sRNAs and genes showed differential expression in Xa3/Xa26-mediated resistance. These differentially expressed sRNAs include known microRNAs (miRNAs), unreported miRNAs, and small interfering RNAs. The candidate genes, with expression that was negatively correlated with the expression of sRNAs, were identified, indicating that these genes may be regulated by sRNAs in disease resistance in rice. These results provide a new perspective regarding the putative roles of sRNA candidates and their putative target genes in durable disease resistance in rice.
NA	Autophagy-Like Cell Death Regulates Hydrogen Peroxide and Calcium Ion Distribution in Xa3/Xa26-Mediated Resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The broad-spectrum and durable resistance gene Xa3/Xa26 against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) has been widely exploited in rice production in China. But the cytological features of the Xa3/Xa26-mediated resistance reaction have been rarely reported. This study reveals the cytological characteristics of the Xa3/Xa26-mediated resistance reaction against Xoo to uncover the functions of hypersensitive response programmed cell death (HR-PCD) in rice. Autophagy-like cell death, which was characterized by double-membrane bodies appearance in xylem parenchyma cell and mesophyll cell, was inhibited by autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenin (3-MA). The autophagy-related genes were induced to reach a high level in resistance reaction. The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) maintained a low concentration on the plasma membrane. The calcium ions localized on the apoplast were transferred into the vacuole. The autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) impaired Xa3/Xa26-mediated resistance by promoting the accumulation of H2O2, and inhibited the transfer of extracellular calcium ions into the vacuole in the xylem parenchyma cells and mesophyll cells. Therefore, the HR-PCD belongs to autophagy-like cell death in the Xa3/Xa26-mediated resistance reaction. These results suggest that the autophagy-like cell death participates in the Xa3/Xa26-mediated resistance by negatively regulating H2O2 accumulation, in order to abolish oxidative stress and possibly activate calcium ion signals in xylem parenchyma cells of the rice leaf.
NA	The Rice Xa3 Gene Confers Resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in the Model Rice Kitaake Genetic Background.	2020	Front Plant Sci	Department of Plant Pathology and the Genome Center, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States.	The rice XA21 and XA3 pattern receptor kinases, derived from Oryza longistaminata and an Oryza. sativa japonica cultivar Wase Aikoku 3, respectively, confer resistance to strains of the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of rice bacterial blight disease. Previously, we showed that transfer of Xa21 to the model rice cultivar Kitaake enhances resistance to Xoo. In this manuscript we demonstrate that Kitaake expressing Xa3 confers resistance to Xoo strain PXO79 and that the stress-related marker genes PR10b and KO5 are upregulated in Xoo-infected Xa3 rice leaves. We also show that rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2 (OsSERK2) positively regulates XA3-mediated immunity in Kitaake. We found that overexpression of XA21 binding protein 15 (XB15) and XB24, two negative regulators of XA21-mediated immunity, do not affect XA3-mediated immunity in the Kitaake genetic background. Our results indicate that the rice immune receptors XA21 and XA3 employ both shared and distinct signaling components in their response to Xoo. The results are important to further understand pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity in rice. Furthermore, the presence of Kitaake rice carrying Xa3 will facilitate genetic research to study the XA3-mediated immunity.
NA	Rapid genotyping of bacterial leaf blight resistant genes of rice using loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay	2021	Mol Biol Rep	Department of Plant Pathology, University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, India. babu_prasanna@rediffmail.com	The use of resistant (R) genes is the most effective strategy to manage bacterial leaf blight (BLB) disease of rice. Several attempts were made to incorporate R genes into susceptible rice cultivars using marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). However, MABB relies exclusively on PCR for foreground selection of R genes, which requires expensive equipment for thermo-cycling and visualization of results; hence, it is limited to sophisticated research facilities. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay do not require thermo-cycling during the assay. Therefore, it will be the best alternative to PCR-based genotyping. In this study, we have developed a LAMP assay for the specific and sensitive genotyping of seven BLB resistance (R) genes viz., Xa1, Xa3, Xa4, Xa7, Xa10, Xa11, and Xa21 in rice. Gene-specific primers were designed for the LAMP assay. The LAMP assay was optimized for time, temperature, and template DNA concentration. For effective detection, incubation at 60 °„C for 30 min was optimum for all seven R genes. A DNA intercalating dye ethidium bromide and a calorimetric dye hydroxynaphthol blue was used for result visualization. Further, sensitivity assay revealed that the LAMP assay could detect R genes at 100 fg of template DNA compared to 1 ng and 10 pg, respectively, in conventional PCR and q-PCR assays. The LAMP assay developed in this study provides a simple, specific, sensitive, robust, and cost-effective method for foreground selection of R genes in the resistance breeding programs of resource-poor laboratory.
