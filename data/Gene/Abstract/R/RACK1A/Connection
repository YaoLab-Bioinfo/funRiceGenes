OsRac1	OsRACK1A	Proteome analysis of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) associated with OsRac1-mediated innate immunity in rice	To examine the possible association of DRMs and OsRac1-mediated innate immunity, we used rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged wild-type (WT) OsRac1 and found that OsRac1 and RACK1A, an effector of OsRac1, shifted to the DRMs after chitin elicitor treatment
OsRACK1A	OsRAR1	RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex	RACK1A was shown to interact with the N terminus of NADPH oxidase, RAR1, and SGT1, key regulators of plant disease resistance
OsRac1	OsRACK1A	RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex	Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1
OsRac1	OsRACK1A	RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex	Rac1 positively regulates RACK1A at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels
OsRac1	OsRACK1A	RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex	These results suggest that RACK1A functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with multiple proteins in the Rac1 immune complex
OsRACK1A	RACK1B|OsWD40-122	RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex	Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1
OsBLR1	OsRACK1A	The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor OsBLR1 regulates leaf angle in rice via brassinosteroid signalling.	 Moreover, we screened OsRACK1A as an interaction protein of OsBLR1 using a yeast two-hybrid assay and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down
