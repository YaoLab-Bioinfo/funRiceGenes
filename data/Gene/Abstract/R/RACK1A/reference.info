pcp077.pdf	Proteome analysis of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) associated with OsRac1-mediated innate immunity in rice	2009	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Protein Analysis, Plant Education Unit, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Takayama, Ikoma, Japan.	OsRac1, a member of the Rac/Rop GTPase family, plays important roles as a molecular switch in rice innate immunity, and the active form of OsRac1 functions in the plasma membrane (PM). To study the precise localization of OsRac1 in the PM and its possible association with other signaling components, we performed proteomic analysis of DRMs (detergent-resistant membranes) isolated from rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged constitutively active (CA) OsRac1. DRMs are regions of the PM that are insoluble after Triton X-100 treatment under cold conditions and are thought to be involved in various signaling processes in animal, yeast and plant cells. We identified 192 proteins in DRMs that included receptor-like kinases (RLKs) such as Xa21, nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR)-type disease resistance proteins, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, syntaxin, NADPH oxidase, a WD-40 repeat family protein and various GTP-binding proteins. Many of these proteins have been previously identified in the DRMs isolated from other plant species, and animal and yeast cells, validating the methods used in our study. To examine the possible association of DRMs and OsRac1-mediated innate immunity, we used rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged wild-type (WT) OsRac1 and found that OsRac1 and RACK1A, an effector of OsRac1, shifted to the DRMs after chitin elicitor treatment. These results suggest that OsRac1-mediated innate immunity is associated with DRMs in the PM.
Plant Cell-2008-Nakashima-2265-79.pdf	RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex	2008	Plant Cell	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma 630-0192, Japan.	A small GTPase, Rac1, plays a key role in rice (Oryza sativa) innate immunity as part of a complex of regulatory proteins. Here, we used affinity column chromatography to identify rice RACK1 (for Receptor for Activated C-Kinase 1) as an interactor with Rac1. RACK1 functions in various mammalian signaling pathways and is involved in hormone signaling and development in plants. Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1. Rac1 positively regulates RACK1A at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. RACK1A transcription was also induced by a fungal elicitor and by abscisic acid, jasmonate, and auxin. Analysis of transgenic rice plants and cell cultures indicates that RACK1A plays a role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in resistance against rice blast infection. Overexpression of RACK1A enhances ROS production in rice seedlings. RACK1A was shown to interact with the N terminus of NADPH oxidase, RAR1, and SGT1, key regulators of plant disease resistance. These results suggest that RACK1A functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with multiple proteins in the Rac1 immune complex.
art%3A10.1186%2F1939-8433-5-35.pdf	OsRap2.6 transcription factor contributes to rice innate immunity through its interaction with Receptor for Activated Kinase-C 1 (RACK1)	2012	Rice (N Y)	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Nara 630-0192, Japan.	BACKGROUND: The rice small GTPase OsRac1 is a molecular switch in rice innate immunity. The Receptor for Activated Kinase C-1 (RACK1) interacts with OsRac1 to suppress the growth of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. RACK1 has two homologs in rice, RACK1A and RACK1B. Overexpressing RACK1A enhances resistance to the rice blast fungus. However, RACK1A downstream signals are largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we report the identification of OsRap2.6, a transcription factor that interacts with RACK1A. We found a 94% similarity between the OsRap2.6 AP2 domain and Arabidopsis Rap2.6 (AtRap2.6). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in rice protoplasts using tagged OsRap2.6 and RACK1A with the C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of Venus (Vc/Vn) indicated that OsRap2.6 and RACK1A interacted and localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Moreover, OsRap2.6 and OsMAPK3/6 interacted in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Expression of defense genes PAL1 and PBZ1 as well as OsRap2.6 was induced after chitin treatment. Disease resistance analysis using OsRap2.6 RNAi and overexpressing (Ox) plants infected with the rice blast fungus indicated that OsRap2.6 RNAi plants were highly susceptible, whereas OsRap2.6 Ox plants had an increased resistance to the compatible blast fungus. CONCLUSIONS: OsRap2.6 contributes to rice innate immunity through its interaction with RACK1A in compatible interactions.
NA	CONSTANS-Like 9 (OsCOL9) Interacts with Receptor for Activated C-Kinase 1(OsRACK1) to Regulate Blast Resistance through Salicylic Acid and Ethylene Signaling Pathways.	2016	PLoS One	National Engineering Research Center of Plant Space Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	In a previous transcriptome analysis of early response genes in rice during Magnaporthe oryzae infection, we identified a CONSTANS-like (COL) gene OsCOL9. In the present study, we investigated the functional roles of OsCOL9 in blast resistance. OsCOL9 belonged to group II of the COL protein family, and it contained a BB-box and a C-terminal CCT (CONSTANS, COL and TOC1) domain. OsCOL9 was found in the nucleus of rice cells, and it exerted transcriptional activation activities through its middle region (MR). Magnaporthe oryzae infection induced OsCOL9 expression, and transgenic OsCOL9 knock-out rice plants showed increased pathogen susceptibility. OsCOL9 was a critical regulator of pathogen-related genes, especially PR1b, which were also activated by exogenous salicylic acid (SA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylicacid (ACC), the precursor of ethylene (ET). Further analysis indicated that OsCOL9 over-expression increased the expressions of phytohormone biosynthetic genes, NPR1, WRKY45, OsACO1 and OsACS1, which were related to SA and ET biosynthesis. Interestingly, we found that OsCOL9 physically interacted with the scaffold protein OsRACK1 through its CCT domain, and the OsRACK1 expression was induced in response to exogenous SA and ACC as well as M. oryzae infection. Taken together, these results indicated that the COL protein OsCOL9 interacted with OsRACK1, and it enhanced the rice blast resistance through SA and ET signaling pathways.
NA	OsRACK1A, encodes a circadian clock-regulated WD40 protein, negatively affect salt tolerance in rice.	2018	Rice (N Y)	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology/Co-Innovation Center for Modern Production Technology of Grain Crop, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, 225009, Jiangsu, China.	The receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is a WD40 type protein that is involved in multiple signaling pathways and is conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Here we report that rice RACK1A (OsRACK1A) is regulated by circadian clocks and plays an important role in the salt stress response. OsRACK1A was found to follow a rhythmic expression profile under circadian conditions at both the transcription and the translation levels, although the expression was arrhythmic under salt stress. Analysis of plant survival rates, fresh weight, proline content, malondialdehyde, and chlorophyll showed that suppression of OsRACK1A enhanced tolerance to salt stress. The ion concentration in both roots and leaves revealed that OsRACK1A-suppressed transgenic rice could maintain low Na+ and high K+ concentrations. Furthermore, OsRACK1A-suppressed transgenic rice accumulated significantly more abscisic acid (ABA) and more transcripts of ABA- and stress-inducible genes compared with the wild-type plants. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that many stress-related genes, including APETALA 2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factors, were upregulated in the OsRACK1A-suppressed transgenic rice line. We identified putative interactors of OsRACK1A, and found that OsRACK1A interacted with many salt stress-responsive proteins directly. These results suggest that OsRACK1A is regulated by circadian rhythm, and involved in the regulation of salt stress responses.
