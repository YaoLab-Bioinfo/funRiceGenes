RBL1	broad-spectrum disease resistance	Genome editing of a rice CDP-DAG synthase confers multipathogen resistance	By using targeted genome editing, we obtained an allele of RBL1, named RBL1Δ12, which confers broad-spectrum disease resistance but does not decrease yield in a model rice variety, as assessed in small-scale field trials.
