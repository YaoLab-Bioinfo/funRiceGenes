Ehd2|RID1	Hd1	Ehd2, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating Ehd1	We discovered an early heading date2 (ehd2) mutant that shows extremely late flowering under both short- and long-day conditions in line with a background deficient in Heading date1 (Hd1), a rice CONSTANS ortholog that belongs to the conserved pathway
Ehd2|RID1	Hd3a	Ehd2, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating Ehd1	To assign the position of Ehd2 within the flowering pathway of rice, we compared transcript levels of previously isolated flowering-time genes, such as Ehd1, a member of the unique pathway, Hd3a, and Rice FT-like1 (RFT1; rice florigens), between the wild-type plants and the ehd2 mutants
Ehd2|RID1	Hd3a	Ehd2, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating Ehd1	Severely reduced expression of these genes in ehd2 under both short- and long-day conditions suggests that Ehd2 acts as a flowering promoter mainly by up-regulating Ehd1 and by up-regulating the downstream Hd3a and RFT1 genes in the unique genetic network of photoperiodic flowering in rice

Ehd2|RID1	FKF1|OsFKF1	Rice FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (OsFKF1) promotes flowering independent of photoperiod.	Transcriptional analysis revealed that OsFKF1 up-regulates expression of the floral activator Ehd2 and down-regulates expression of the floral repressor Ghd7; these regulators up- and down-regulate Ehd1 expression, respectively
Ehd2|RID1	FKF1|OsFKF1	Rice FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (OsFKF1) promotes flowering independent of photoperiod.	Moreover, OsFKF1 can upregulate Ehd1 expression under blue light treatment, without affecting the expression of Ehd2 and Ghd7
Ehd2|RID1	FKF1|OsFKF1	Rice FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (OsFKF1) promotes flowering independent of photoperiod.	In contrast to the LD-specific floral activator Arabidopsis FKF1, OsFKF1 likely acts as an autonomous floral activator because it promotes flowering independent of photoperiod, probably via its distinct roles in controlling expression of rice-specific genes including Ehd2, Ghd7, and Ehd1
Ehd2|RID1	SID1|OsIDD4	Suppressor of rid1 (SID1) shares common targets with RID1 on florigen genes to initiate floral transition in rice.	Suppressor of rid1 (SID1) shares common targets with RID1 on florigen genes to initiate floral transition in rice.
Ehd2|RID1	SID1|OsIDD4	Suppressor of rid1 (SID1) shares common targets with RID1 on florigen genes to initiate floral transition in rice.	Here, we identified a Suppressor of rid1 (SID1), which rescues the never-flowering phenotype of rid1

Ehd2|RID1	OsCOL15	The rice CONSTANS-like protein OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by promoting Ghd7 and repressing RID1.	 Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of flowering regulator gene expression suggested that OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by up-regulating the flowering repressor Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and down-regulating the flowering activator Rice Indeterminate 1 (RID1), thus leading to the down-regulation of the flowering activators Early heading date 1, Heading date 3a, and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1
Ehd2|RID1	OsCOL15	The rice CONSTANS-like protein OsCOL15 suppresses flowering by promoting Ghd7 and repressing RID1.	 These results demonstrate that OsCOL15 is an important floral regulator acting upstream of Ghd7 and RID1 in the rice photoperiodic flowering-time regulatory network
