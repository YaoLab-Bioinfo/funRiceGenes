The virescent3 (v3) and stripe1 (st1) mutants in rice (Oryza sativa) produce chlorotic leaves in a growth stage-dependent manner under field conditions. They are temperature-conditional mutants that produce bleached leaves at a constant 20 degrees C or 30 degrees C but almost green leaves under diurnal 30 degrees C/20 degrees C conditions. Here, we show V3 and St1, which encode the large and small subunits of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), RNRL1, and RNRS1, respectively. RNR regulates the rate of deoxyribonucleotide production for DNA synthesis and repair. RNRL1 and RNRS1 are highly expressed in the shoot base and in young leaves, and the expression of the genes that function in plastid transcription/translation and in photosynthesis is altered in v3 and st1 mutants, indicating that a threshold activity of RNR is required for chloroplast biogenesis in developing leaves. There are additional RNR homologs in rice, RNRL2 and RNRS2, and eukaryotic RNRs comprise alpha(2)beta(2) heterodimers. In yeast, RNRL1 interacts with RNRS1 (RNRL1:RNRS1) and RNRL2:RNRS2, but no interaction occurs between other combinations of the large and small subunits. The interacting activities are RNRL1:RNRS1 > RNRL1:rnrs1(st1) > rnrl1(v3):RNRS1 > rnrl1(v3):rnrs1(st1), which correlate with the degree of chlorosis for each genotype. This suggests that missense mutations in rnrl1(v3) and rnrs1(st1) attenuate the first alphabeta dimerization. Moreover, wild-type plants exposed to a low concentration of an RNR inhibitor, hydroxyurea, produce chlorotic leaves without growth retardation, reminiscent of v3 and st1 mutants. We thus propose that upon insufficient activity of RNR, plastid DNA synthesis is preferentially arrested to allow nuclear genome replication in developing leaves, leading to continuous plant growth.
NA	Rice gene SDL/RNRS1, encoding the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, is required for chlorophyll synthesis and plant growth development.	2017	Gene	Department of Agronomy, College of Agriculture Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	A new mutant named sdl (stripe and drooping leaf) was characterized from indica cultivar Zhenong 34 by ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. The mutant sdl exhibited development defects including stripe and drooping leaf, dwarfism and deformed floral organs. The gene SDL was found allelic to RNRS1 by map-based cloning, which was homologous to Arabidopsis TSO2 encoding the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. The gDNA sequencing results of sdl in mutant consistently showed that there was a repetitive sequence insertion of 138-bp at the 475th bp in the exon. The redundant sequence was conserved in SDL homologous proteins, which contained the active site (tyrosine), as well as two amino acids glutamate and histidine involved in the binding of iron. There were fewer chloroplasts and grana lamellas in sdl leaf compared with those of wild-type. Additionally, the stripe leaf of sdl seedlings was highly sensitive to temperature, since the chlorophyll content was increased with the temperature rising. The drooping leaf of sdl might be resulted from the disappearance of vascular bundles and mesophyll cells in both leaf midrib and lateral veins. Fittingly to the phenotypes of mutant sdl, the expression levels of genes associated with photosynthesis and chlorophyll synthesis were found to be down- or up-regulated at different temperatures in mutant sdl. Also, the transcriptional levels of genes related to plant height and floral organ formation showed obvious differences between wild-type and sdl. The &quot;SDL/RNRS1&quot; was, hence, required for the chlorophyll biosynthesis and also played pleiotropic roles in the regulation of plant development.
NA	Narrow and Stripe Leaf 2 Regulates Leaf Width by Modulating Cell Cycle Progression in Rice.	2023	Rice (N Y)	Rice Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Engineering Research Center of South Upland Agriculture, Ministry of Education, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, China.	BACKGROUND: Leaf morphology is an important component of the idea plant architecture that extensively influences photosynthesis, transpiration, and ultimately grain yield in crops. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms regulating this morphology remain largely unclear. RESULTS: In this study, a mutant showing a narrow and stripe leaf phonotype, designated nsl2, was obtained. Histological analysis revealed defects in the vascular system and reduced epidermal cell number in the nsl2, while the cell size remained unchanged. Map-based cloning and genetic complementation experiments revealed that NSL2, which encodes a small subunit of ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs), is a null allelic with ST1 and SDL. The NSL2 was expressed in variety of tissues, with the highest levels detected in leaves, and its protein was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The dNTPs level was altered in the nsl2 mutant, and thereby affecting the dNTPs pool balance. In addition, flow cytometric analysis and the altered transcript level of genes related to cell cycle indicated that NSL2 affects cell cycle progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings here suggest that NSL2 function in the synthesis of dNTP, the deficient of which leads to DNA synthesis block and in turn affects cell cycle progression, and ultimately decreased cell number and narrow leaf in the nsl2 plant.
