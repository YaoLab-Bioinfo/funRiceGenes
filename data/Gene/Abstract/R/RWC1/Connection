OsPIP1;1|RWC1	OsPIP1;2	The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination	Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds
OsPIP1;1|RWC1	RWC3|OsPIP1;3	The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination	Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions
OsPIP1;1|RWC1	RWC3|OsPIP1;3	The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination	Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds
LP2	OsPIP1;1|RWC1	Plasma membrane receptor-like kinase leaf panicle 2 acts downstream of the DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE transcription factor to regulate drought sensitivity in rice	In addition, LP2 was identified as a functional kinase localized to the plasma membrane and interacted with the drought-responsive aquaporin proteins OsPIP1; 1, OsPIP1; 3, and OsPIP2; 3.
OsHIPL1	OsPIP1;1|RWC1	OsHIPL1, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.	 Meanwhile, we found that OsHIPL1 interacted with the aquaporin OsPIP1;1, then affected water uptake to promote rice seed germination
