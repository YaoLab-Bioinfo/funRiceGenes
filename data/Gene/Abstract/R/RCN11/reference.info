NA	The rice RCN11 gene encodes β1,2-xylosyltransferase and is required for plant responses to abiotic stresses and phytohormones.	2015	Plant Sci	Department of Agro-environmental Science, Obihiro University of Agricultural and Veterinary Medicine, 2-11 Nishi, Inada, Obihiro, Hokkaido 080-8555, Japan.	Seed germination rates and plant development and growth under abiotic stress are important aspects of crop productivity. Here, our characterization of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant reduced culm number11 (rcn11) showed that RCN11 controls growth of plants exposed to abnormal temperature, salinity and drought conditions. RCN11 also mediates root aerenchyma formation under oxygen-deficient conditions and ABA sensitivity during seed germination. Molecular studies showed that the rcn11 mutation resulted from a 966-bp deletion that caused loss of function of β1,2-xylosyltransferase (OsXylT). This enzyme is located in the Golgi apparatus where it catalyzes the transfer of xylose from UDP-xylose to the core β-linked mannose of N-glycans. RCN11/OsXylT promoter activity was observed in the basal part of the shoot containing the shoot and axillary meristems and in the base of crown roots. The level of RCN11/OsXylT expression was regulated by multiple phytohormones and various abiotic stresses suggesting that plant specific N-glycosylation is regulated by multiple signals in rice plants. The present study is the first to demonstrate that rice β1,2-linked xylose residues on N-glycans are critical for seed germination and plant development and growth under conditions of abiotic stress.
NA	The rice REDUCED CULM NUMBER11 gene controls vegetative growth under low-temperature conditions in paddy fields independent of RCN1/OsABCG5.	2013	Plant Sci	Department of Crop Science, Obihiro University of Agricultural and Veterinary Medicine, 2-11 Nishi, Inada, Obihiro, Hokkaido, Japan.	Low temperature tolerance during vegetative growth is an important objective in rice (Oryza sativa L.) breeding programs. We isolated a novel reduced culm number mutant, designated reduced culm number11 (rcn11), by screening under low-temperature condition in a paddy fields. Since the shoot architecture of the rcn11 was very similar to that of the rcn1, we examined whether RCN11 is involved in RCN1/OsABCG5-associated vegetative growth control. The rcn11 mutant has no mutation in the RCN1/OsABCG5 gene and rcn11 has no effect on RCN1/OsABCG5 gene expression. In the rcn1 mutant, RCN1/OsABCG5 was upregulated showing that RCN1/OsABCG5 is controlled by negative feedback regulation. Absence of an effect of rcn11 on RCN1/OsABCG5 feedback regulation supported that RCN11 is not involved in the RCN1/OsABCG5-associated transport system. A genetic allelism test and molecular mapping study showed that rcn11 is independent of rcn1 on rice chromosome 3 and located on chromosome 8. The rcn1 rcn11 phenotype suggests that RCN11 acts on vegetative growth independent of RCN1/OsABCG5. A root development comparison between rcn1 and rcn11 in young seedlings represented that rcn11 reduced crown root number and elongation, whereas rcn1 reduced lateral root density and elongation. Thus, rcn11 will shed new light on vegetative growth control under low temperature.
