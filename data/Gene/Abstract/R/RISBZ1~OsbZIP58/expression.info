RISBZ1|OsbZIP58|OsSMF1	 OsSMF1 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of Os03g0168500 (GCN4 motif), patatin-like gene (GCN4 motif), Î±-globulin (ACGT motif), rice prolamin box-binding factor (RPBF) (ATGA motif), and ONAC024 (GCN4 and ACGT motifs) and to regulate their expression
RISBZ1|OsbZIP58|OsSMF1	 The OsbZIP58 gene promotes expression of many seed storage protein genes and starch synthesis genes while inhibits expression of some starch hydrolyzing ¦Á-amylase genes under HT
