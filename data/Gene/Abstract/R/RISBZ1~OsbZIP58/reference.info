55776188.pdf	Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain	2010	Plant Cell Physiol	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Transgenic Crop Research & Development Center, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Lysine is the most deficient essential amino acid in cereal grains. A bifunctional lysine-degrading enzyme, lysine ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase (LKR/SDH), is one of the key regulators determining free lysine content in plants. In rice (Oryza sativa. L), a bifunctional OsLKR/SDH is predominantly present in seeds. Here, we show that OsLKR/SDH is directly regulated by major transcriptional regulators of seed storage protein (SSP) genes: the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF), RISBZ1, and the DNA-binding with one finger (DOF) transcription factor, RPBF. OsLKR/SDH was highly expressed in the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm. Mutation analyses in planta, trans-activation reporter assays in vivo and electrophorestic mobility shift assays in vitro showed that the RPBF-recognizing prolamin box (AAAG) and the RISBZ1-recognizing GCN4 motif (TGAG/CTCA) act as important cis-elements for proper expression of OsLKR/SDH like SSP genes. However, mutation of the GCN4 motif within ProOsLKR/SDH did not alter the spatial expression pattern, whereas mutation of the GCN4 motif within ProGluB-1 did alter spatial expression. Reducing either RISBZ1 or RPBF decreased OsLKR/SDH levels, resulting in an increase in free lysine content in rice grain. This result was in contrast to the fact that a significant reduction of SSP was observed only when these transcription factors were simultaneously reduced, suggesting that RISBZ1 and RPBF regulate SSP genes and OsLKR/SDH with high and limited redundancy, respectively. The same combinations of TF and cis-elements are involved in the regulation of OsLKR/SDH and SSP genes, but there is a distinct difference in their regulation mechanisms.
ert187.pdf	OsbZIP58, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, regulates starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm	2013	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, PR China.	Starch composition and the amount in endosperm, both of which contribute dramatically to seed yield, cooking quality, and taste in cereals, are determined by a series of complex biochemical reactions. However, the mechanism regulating starch biosynthesis in cereal seeds is not well understood. This study showed that OsbZIP58, a bZIP transcription factor, is a key transcriptional regulator controlling starch synthesis in rice endosperm. OsbZIP58 was expressed mainly in endosperm during active starch synthesis. osbzip58 null mutants displayed abnormal seed morphology with altered starch accumulation in the white belly region and decreased amounts of total starch and amylose. Moreover, osbzip58 had a higher proportion of short chains and a lower proportion of intermediate chains of amylopectin. Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, OsSSIIa, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression. These findings indicate that OsbZIP58 functions as a key regulator of starch synthesis in rice seeds and provide new insights into seed quality control.
J. Biol. Chem.-2001-Onodera-14139-52.pdf	A rice functional transcriptional activator, RISBZ1, responsible for endosperm-specific expression of storage protein genes through GCN4 motif	2001	J Biol Chem	Department of Biotechnology, National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The GCN4 motif, a cis-element that is highly conserved in the promoters of cereal seed storage protein genes, plays a central role in controlling endosperm-specific expression. This motif is the recognition site for a basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor that belongs to the group of maize Opaque-2 (O2)-like proteins. Five different basic leucine zipper cDNA clones, designated RISBZ1-5, have been isolated from a rice seed cDNA library. The predicted gene products can be divided into two groups based on their amino acid sequences. Although all the RISBZ proteins are able to interact with the GCN4 motif, only RISBZ1 is capable of activating (more than 100-fold expression) the expression of a reporter gene under a minimal promoter fused to a pentamer of the GCN4 motif. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments using the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain revealed that the proline-rich N-terminal domain (27 amino acids in length) is responsible for transactivation. The RISBZ1 protein is capable of forming homodimers as well as heterodimers with other RISBZ subunit proteins. RISBZ1 gene expression is restricted to the seed, where it precedes the expression of storage protein genes. When the RISBZ1 promoter was transcriptionally fused to the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene and the chimeric gene was introduced into rice, the beta-glucuronidase gene is specifically expressed in aleurone and subaleurone layer of the developing endosperm. These findings suggest that the specific expression of transcriptional activator RISBZ1 gene may determine the endosperm specificity of the storage protein genes.
j.1365-313X.2009.03925.x.pdf	Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice	2009	Plant J	Transgenic Crop Research and Development Centre, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The rice (Oryza sativa L.) basic leucine Zipper factor RISBZ1 and rice prolamin box binding factor (RPBF) are transcriptional activators of rice seed storage protein (SSP) genes in vivo. To ascertain the functions of these trans-activators in seed development, knock-down (KD) transgenic rice plants were generated in which the accumulation of RISBZ1 and RPBF was reduced in an endosperm-specific manner by co-suppression (KD-RISBZ1 and KD-RPBF). The accumulation of most SSPs changed little between individual KD mutants and wild-type plants, whereas a double KD mutant (KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF) resulted in a significant reduction of most SSP gene expression and accumulation. The reduction of both trans-activators also caused a greater reduction in seed starch accumulation than individual KD mutants. Storage lipids were accumulated at reduced levels in KD-RISBZ1 and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF seeds. KD-RPBF and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF seeds exhibited multi-layered aleurone cells. Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF. These phenotypes suggest that combinatorial interactions between RISBZ1 and RPBF play an essential role during grain filling. The functional redundancy and compensation between RISBZ1 and RPBF possibly account for weak effects on the SSP levels in single KD mutants, and help maintain various processes during seed development in rice. Physical interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF may ensure that these processes are carried out properly.
Nijhawan-2008-Genomic survey and g.pdf	Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
pp1411694.pdf	Synergism between RPBF Dof and RISBZ1 bZIP activators in the regulation of rice seed expression genes	2006	Plant Physiol	Transgenic Crop Research and Development Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The Dof (DNA binding with one finger) transcriptional activator rice (Oryza sativa) prolamin box binding factor (RPBF), which is involved in gene regulation of rice seed storage proteins, has been isolated from rice cDNA expressed sequence tag clones containing the conserved Dof. RPBF is found as a single gene per haploid genome. Comparison of RPBF genomic and cDNA sequences revealed that the genomic copy is interrupted by one long intron of 1,892 bp in the 5' noncoding region. We demonstrated by transient expression in rice callus protoplasts that the isolated RPBF trans-activated several storage protein genes via an AAAG target sequence located within their promoters, and with methylation interference experiments the additional AAAG-like sequences in promoters of genes expressed in maturing seeds were recognized by the RPBF protein. Binding was sequence specific, since mutation of the AAAG motif or its derivatives decreased both binding and trans-activation by RPBF. Synergism between RPBF and RISBZ1 recognizing the GCN4 motif [TGA(G/C)TCA] was observed in the expression of many storage protein genes. Overexpression of both transcription factors gave rise to much higher levels of expression than the sum of individual activities elicited by either RPBF or RISBZ1 alone. Furthermore, mutation of recognition sites suppressed reciprocal trans-activation ability, indicating that there are mutual interactions between RISBZ1 and RPBF. The RPBF gene is predominantly expressed in maturing endosperm and coordinately expressed with seed storage protein genes, and is involved in the quantitative regulation of genes expressed in the endosperm in cooperation with RISBZ1.
NA	OsLOL1, a C2C2-type zinc finger protein, interacts with OsbZIP58 to promote seed germination through the modulation of gibberellin biosynthesis in Oryza sativa	2014	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Seed germination is a key developmental process in the plant life cycle that is influenced by various environmental cues and phytohormones through gene expression and a series of metabolism pathways. In the present study, we investigated a C2C2-type finger protein, OsLOL1, which promotes gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and affects seed germination in Oryza sativa (rice). We used OsLOL1 antisense and sense transgenic lines to explore OsLOL1 functions. Seed germination timing in antisense plants was restored to wild type when exogenous GA3 was applied. The reduced expression of the GA biosynthesis gene OsKO2 and the accumulation of ent-kaurene were observed during germination in antisense plants. Based on yeast two-hybrid and firefly luciferase complementation analyses, OsLOL1 interacted with the basic leucine zipper protein OsbZIP58. The results from electrophoretic mobility shift and dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that OsbZIP58 binds the G-box cis-element of the OsKO2 promoter and activates LUC reporter gene expression, and that interaction between OsLOL1 and OsbZIP58 activates OsKO2 gene expression. In addition, OsLOL1 decreased SOD1 gene expression and accelerated programmed cell death (PCD) in the aleurone layer of rice grains. These findings demonstrate that the interaction between OsLOL1 and OsbZIP58 influences GA biosynthesis through the activation of OsKO2 via OsbZIP58, thereby stimulating aleurone PCD and seed germination.
NA	Genome-wide identification of grain filling genes regulated by the OsSMF1 transcription factor in rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	Division of Bioscience and Bioinformatics, Myongji University, Yongin, Kyonggido, 449-728, Republic of Korea.	Spatial- and temporal-specific expression patterns are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level by gene promoters. Therefore, it is important to identify the binding motifs of transcription factors to better understand the networks associated with embryogenesis.Here, we used a protein-binding microarray (PBM) to identify the binding motifs of OsSMF1, which is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor involved in the regulation of rice seed maturation. OsSMF1 (previously called RISBZ1 or OsbZIP58) is known to interact with GCN4 motifs (TGA(G/C)TCA) to regulate seed storage protein synthesis, and it functions as a key regulator of starch synthesis. Quadruple 9-mer-based PBM analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that OsSMF1 bound to the GCN4 (TGA(G/C)TCA), ACGT (CCACGT(C/G)), and ATGA (GGATGAC) motifs with three different affinities. We predicted 44 putative OsSMF1 target genes using data obtained from both the PBM and RiceArrayNet. Among these putative target genes, 18, 21, and 13 genes contained GCN4, ACGT, and ATGA motifs within their 1-kb promoter regions, respectively. Among them, six genes encoding major grain filling proteins and transcription factors were chosen to confirm the activation of their expression in vivo. OsSMF1 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of Os03g0168500 (GCN4 motif), patatin-like gene (GCN4 motif), Î±-globulin (ACGT motif), rice prolamin box-binding factor (RPBF) (ATGA motif), and ONAC024 (GCN4 and ACGT motifs) and to regulate their expression.The results of this study suggest that OsSMF1 is one of the key transcription factors that functions in a wide range of seed developmental processes with different specific binding affinities for the three DNA-binding motifs.
NA	High temperature inhibits the accumulation of storage materials by inducing alternative splicing of OsbZIP58 during filling stage in rice.	2020	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Institute of Virology and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.	High temperature (HT) has an adverse effect on rice grain filling by inhibiting the accumulation of storage materials. However, the regulatory mechanism of this inhibition remains unknown. Here, we report that Opaque2 like transcription factor OsbZIP58 is a key factor regulating storage material accumulation under HT. The OsbZIP58 gene promotes expression of many seed storage protein genes and starch synthesis genes while inhibits expression of some starch hydrolyzing ¦Á-amylase genes under HT. The loss of OsbZIP58 function leads to floury and shrunken endosperms and dramatically reduced storage materials in the seeds under HT. HT is found to affect alternative splicing of OsbZIP58, promoting the formation of the truncated OsbZIP58¦Â protein form over the full-length OsbZIP58¦Á protein form. The OsbZIP58¦Â form has a lower transcriptional activity than the OsbZIP58¦Á form, especially under HT condition. Interestingly, rice varieties with less heat sensitivity have reduced alternative splicing of OsbZIP58. Therefore, OsbZIP58 is a crucial gene in regulating storage material accumulation under HT and lower alternative splicing of OsbZIP58 may contribute to heat tolerance during grain filling.
