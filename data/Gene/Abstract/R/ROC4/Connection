Ghd7	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	Whereas constitutive overexpression of Roc4 in â€˜Dongjinâ€<U+393C><U+3E39> japonica rice, which carries active Ghd7, also caused LD-preferential early flowering, its overexpression in â€˜Longjing27â€‘ù<U+3E32> rice, which is defective in functional Ghd7, did not produce the same result
Ghd7	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	This confirmed that Roc4 regulates flowering time mainly through Ghd7
Ghd7	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	All of these findings are evidence that Roc4 is an LD-preferential flowering enhancer that functions downstream of phytochromes and OsGI, but upstream of Ghd7
OsGI	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	sativa GIGANTEA (OsGI) function upstream of Roc4
