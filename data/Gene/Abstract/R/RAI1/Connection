OsMKK4|LARGE11	RAI1	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	Also, RAI1 was phosphorylated by OsMAPK3/6 and OsMKK4-dd in vitro
OsMKK4|LARGE11	RAI1	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	Therefore, the regulation of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression by RAI1 could be controlled via an OsMKK4-OsMAPK3/6 cascade
OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	RAI1	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	RAI1 interacted with OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 proteins in vivo and in vitro
OsMPK1|OsMAPK6|OsSIPK	RAI1	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity
OsRac1	RAI1	Importance of OsRac1 and RAI1 in signalling of NLR protein-mediated resistance to rice blast disease.	Importance of OsRac1 and RAI1 in signalling of NLR protein-mediated resistance to rice blast disease.
OsRac1	RAI1	Importance of OsRac1 and RAI1 in signalling of NLR protein-mediated resistance to rice blast disease.	 We also identified RAI1, a transcriptional activator, as a PID3 interactor required for PID3-mediated blast resistance and showed that RAI1 expression is induced by PID3 via a process mediated by OsRac1
OsRac1	RAI1	Importance of OsRac1 and RAI1 in signalling of NLR protein-mediated resistance to rice blast disease.	 This study describes a new signalling pathway for NLR protein-mediated blast resistance and shows that OsRac1 and RAI1 act together to play a critical role in this process
