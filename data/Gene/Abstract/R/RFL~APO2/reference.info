The temporal and spatial control of meristem identity is a key element in plant development. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate inflorescence and flower architecture, we characterized the rice aberrant panicle organization 2 (apo2) mutant which exhibits small panicles with reduced number of primary branches due to the precocious formation of spikelet meristems. The apo2 mutants also display a shortened plastochron in the vegetative phase, late flowering, aberrant floral organ identities and loss of floral meristem determinacy. Map-based cloning revealed that APO2 is identical to previously reported RFL gene, the rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis LEAFY (LFY) gene. Further analysis indicated that APO2/RFL and APO1, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, act cooperatively to control inflorescence and flower development. The present study revealed functional differences between APO2/RFL and LFY. In particular, APO2/RFL and LFY act oppositely on inflorescence development. Therefore, the genetic mechanisms for controlling inflorescence architecture have evolutionarily diverged between rice (monocots) and Arabidopsis (eudicots).
PNAS-2008-Rao-3646-51.pdf	Distinct regulatory role for RFL, the rice LFY homolog, in determining flowering time and plant architecture	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.	Activity of axillary meristems dictates the architecture of both vegetative and reproductive parts of a plant. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a model eudicot species, the transcription factor LFY confers a floral fate to new meristems arising from the periphery of the reproductive shoot apex. Diverse orthologous LFY genes regulate vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition when expressed in Arabidopsis, a property not shared by RFL, the homolog in the agronomically important grass, rice. We have characterized RFL by knockdown of its expression and by its ectopic overexpression in transgenic rice. We find that reduction in RFL expression causes a dramatic delay in transition to flowering, with the extreme phenotype being no flowering. Conversely, RFL overexpression triggers precocious flowering. In these transgenics, the expression levels of known flowering time genes reveal RFL as a regulator of OsSOC1 (OsMADS50), an activator of flowering. Aside from facilitating a transition of the main growth axis to an inflorescence meristem, RFL expression status affects vegetative axillary meristems and therefore regulates tillering. The unique spatially and temporally regulated RFL expression during the development of vegetative axillary bud (tiller) primordia and inflorescence branch primordia is therefore required to produce tillers and panicle branches, respectively. Our data provide mechanistic insights into a unique role for RFL in determining the typical rice plant architecture by regulating distinct downstream pathways. These results offer a means to alter rice flowering time and plant architecture by manipulating RFL-mediated pathways.
pq001979.pdf	Down-regulation of RFL, the FLO/LFY homolog of rice, accompanied with panicle branch initiation	1998	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, 630-01 Japan. 	FLORICAULA (FLO) of Antirrhinum and LEAFY (FLY) of Arabidopsis regulate the formation of floral meristems. To examine whether same mechanisms control floral development in distantly related species such as grasses, we isolated RFL, FLO-LFY homolog of rice, and examined its expression and function. Northern analysis showed that RFL is expressed predominantly in very young panicle but not in mature florets, mature leaves, or roots. In situ hybridization revealed that RFL RNA was expressed in epidermal cells in young leaves at vegetative growth stage. After the transition to reproductive stage, RFL RNA was detected in all layers of very young panicle including the apical meristem, but absent in the incipient primary branches. As development of branches proceeds, RFL RNA accumulation localized in the developing branches except for the apical meristems of the branches and secondary branch primordia. Expression pattern of RFL raised a possibility that, unlike FLO and LFY, RFL might be involved in panicle branching. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing RFL from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were produced to test whether 35S-RFL would cause similar phenotype as observed in 35S-LFY plants. In 35S-RFL plants, transformation of inflorescence meristem to floral meristem was rarely observed. Instead, development of cotyledons, rosette leaves, petals, and stamens was severely affected, demonstrating that RFL function is distinct from that of LFY. Our results suggest that mechanisms controlling floral development in rice might be diverged from that of Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum.

tpj5126.pdf	Dwarf and deformed flower 1, encoding an F-box protein, is critical for vegetative and floral development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2012	Plant J	Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Genetics, Breeding and Multiple Utilization of Crops, Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China. ylduan863@fjau.edu.cn	Recent studies have shown that F-box proteins constitute a large family in eukaryotes, and play pivotal roles in regulating various developmental processes in plants. However, their functions in monocots are still obscure. In this study, we characterized a recessive mutant dwarf and deformed flower 1-1 (ddf1-1) in Oryza sativa (rice). The mutant is abnormal in both vegetative and reproductive development, with significant size reduction in all organs except the spikelet. DDF1 controls organ size by regulating both cell division and cell expansion. In the ddf1-1 spikelet, the specification of floral organs in whorls 2 and 3 is altered, with most lodicules and stamens being transformed into glume-like organs and pistil-like organs, respectively, but the specification of lemma/palea and pistil in whorls 1 and 4 is not affected. DDF1 encodes an F-box protein anchored in the nucleolus, and is expressed in almost all vegetative and reproductive tissues. Consistent with the mutant floral phenotype, DDF1 positively regulates B-class genes OsMADS4 and OsMADS16, and negatively regulates pistil specification gene DL. In addition, DDF1 also negatively regulates the Arabidopsis LFY ortholog APO2, implying a functional connection between DDF1 and APO2. Collectively, these results revealed that DDF1, as a newly identified F-box gene, is a crucial genetic factor with pleiotropic functions for both vegetative growth and floral organ specification in rice. These findings provide additional insights into the molecular mechanism controlling monocot vegetative and reproductive development.
NA	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	2015	J Exp Bot	Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.	Axillary meristems (AMs) are secondary shoot meristems whose outgrowth determines plant architecture. In rice, AMs form tillers, and tillering mutants reveal an interplay between transcription factors and the phytohormones auxin and strigolactone as some factors that underpin this developmental process. Previous studies showed that knockdown of the transcription factor gene RFL reduced tillering and caused a very large decrease in panicle branching. Here, the relationship between RFL, AM initiation, and outgrowth was examined. We show that RFL promotes AM specification through its effects on LAX1 and CUC genes, as their expression was modulated on RFL knockdown, on induction of RFL:GR fusion protein, and by a repressive RFL-EAR fusion protein. Further, we report reduced expression of auxin transporter genes OsPIN1 and OsPIN3 in the culm of RFL knockdown transgenic plants. Additionally, subtle change in the spatial pattern of IR4 DR5:GFP auxin reporter was observed, which hints at compromised auxin transport on RFL knockdown. The relationship between RFL, strigolactone signalling, and bud outgrowth was studied by transcript analyses and by the tillering phenotype of transgenic plants knocked down for both RFL and D3. These data suggest indirect RFL-strigolactone links that may affect tillering. Further, we show expression modulation of the auxin transporter gene OsPIN3 upon RFL:GR protein induction and by the repressive RFL-EAR protein. These modified forms of RFL had only indirect effects on OsPIN1. Together, we have found that RFL regulates the LAX1 and CUC genes during AM specification, and positively influences the outgrowth of AMs though its effects on auxin transport.
NA	The far-upstream regulatory region of RFL is required for its precise spatial-temporal expression for floral development in rice.	2016	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	A rice mutant aberrant floral organ 1 (afo1) was identified, showing increased floral organ number, aberrant floral organ identity and loss of floral meristem determinacy. A disruption of sequence integrity at 6292-bp upstream of RFL by a T-DNA insertion led to varied RFL expression patterns in floral meristem and floret in afo1 and caused the mutant phenotype. The LEAFY (LFY) transcription factor and its homologs affect many aspects of plant development, especially floral development. RICE FLORICAULA/LEAFY (RFL), the rice ortholog of LFY, has complicated expression patterns and different functions in floral development. However, the mechanisms regulating the spatial-temporal expression of RFL remain largely unknown. Here, we describe a rice aberrant floral organ 1 (afo1) mutant that was produced by a T-DNA insertion at 6292-bp upstream of the start codon of RFL. This insertion altered the expression of RFL in floral meristem (FM) and floret. The in situ hybridization result showed that, when florets appear, RFL was expressed almost exclusively at the palea/lemma adaxial base adjacent to lodicules in the wild-type panicle. However, in afo1 florets, RFL mRNA signals were detected in the region between lodicule and stamen, and strong signals persisted in FM. The altered pattern of RFL expression in afo1 resulted in enlarged FMs, more floral organs, aberrant floral organ identity, and loss of FM determinacy. Transformation of rice with an RFL construct driven by the 6292-bp upstream genomic sequence re-built the mutant phenotype similar to afo1. The results suggest that the far-upstream region of RFL may contain potential cis element(s) that are critical to define the precise spatial-temporal expression pattern of RFL for its function in floral development.
NA	Short and Solid Culm/RFL/APO2 for culm development in rice.	2017	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Plant Gene Research Center, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.	The culm development of rice is characterized by elongation and medullary cavity (MC) formation, which are determined by node formation meristem and residual meristem, respectively. Although many factors have been shown to affect culm elongation, molecules involved in MC formation remained to be identified. In this study, we show that a pint mutation in SHORT and SOLID CULM (SSC), the rice homolog of Arabidopsis LFY, resulted in plants with drastically reduced culm length and completely abolished MC formation. Analysis of transgenic plants with moderately enhanced SSC expression revealed significant decreases in plant height and MC size in contrast to slight changes in heading date, indicating that the culm developmental process is much more tightly monitored by the gene. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the differential expression of knotted-1 like homeobox (KNOX) protein genes and gibberellin (GA) metabolic genes in the ssc mutant background, and most of the genes contained well-conserved LFY binding cis-elements that could be effectively recognized by SSC. Genetic analysis found that the reduced culm length of the mutant could be largely rescued by the GA-accumulating mutation eui, whereas MC formation remained unchanged in the double mutant plants. Taken together, our results suggest that SSC affects culm elongation mainly through maintaining GA homeostasis, while functions in MC formation by mediating residual meristem activity possibly via the KNOX pathway. The present study provides a potential strategy for improving the culm morphology and plant architecture in rice by manipulating SSC and/or its downstream components.

NA	Transcriptome comparison between pluripotent and non-pluripotent calli derived from mature rice seeds	2020	Sci Rep	Department of Chemistry, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea.	In vitro plant regeneration involves a two-step practice of callus formation and de novo organogenesis. During callus formation, cellular competence for tissue regeneration is acquired, but it is elusive what molecular processes and genetic factors are involved in establishing cellular pluripotency. To explore the mechanisms underlying pluripotency acquisition during callus formation in monocot plants, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the pluripotent and non-pluripotent rice calli using RNA-seq. We obtained a dataset of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which accounts for molecular processes underpinning pluripotency acquisition and maintenance. Core regulators establishing root stem cell niche were implicated in pluripotency acquisition in rice callus, as observed in Arabidopsis. In addition, KEGG analysis showed that photosynthetic process and sugar and amino acid metabolism were substantially suppressed in pluripotent calli, whereas lipid and antioxidant metabolism were overrepresented in up-regulated DEGs. We also constructed a putative coexpression network related to cellular pluripotency in rice and proposed potential candidates conferring pluripotency in rice callus. Overall, our transcriptome-based analysis can be a powerful resource for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms establishing cellular pluripotency in rice callus.
