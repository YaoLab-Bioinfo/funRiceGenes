We propose that OsHAPL1 functions as a transcriptional regulator and, together with DTH8, Hd1, the HAP complex, and general transcription factors, regulates the expression of target genes and then affects heading date by influencing the expression of Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1
OsCOL10	OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a|RFT1	Flowering time regulation by the CONSTANS-Like gene OsCOL10.	Through transgenic analysis, we have showed that OsCOL10 repress flowering by reducing expression of the FT-like genes RFT1 and Hd3a through Ehd1
OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a|RFT1	SID1|OsIDD4	Suppressor of rid1 (SID1) shares common targets with RID1 on florigen genes to initiate floral transition in rice.	Further analyses showed SID1 and RID1 directly target the promoter regions of Hd3a and RFT1, two florigen genes in rice
OsFTIP1	OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a|RFT1	OsFTIP1-Mediated Regulation of Florigen Transport in Rice Is Negatively Regulated by a Ubiquitin-like Domain Kinase OsUbDKγ4.	 Here we show that rice FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (OsFTIP1), a member of the family of multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) and the closest ortholog of Arabidopsis FTIP1, is required for export of RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) from companion cells to sieve elements
OsFTIP1	OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a|RFT1	OsFTIP1-Mediated Regulation of Florigen Transport in Rice Is Negatively Regulated by a Ubiquitin-like Domain Kinase OsUbDKγ4.	 We further reveal that a ubiquitin-like domain kinase γ4, OsUbDKγ4, interacts with OsFTIP1, and modulates its degradation in leaves through the 26S proteasome, which in turn affects RFT1 transport to the SAM
OsFTIP1	OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a|RFT1	OsFTIP1-Mediated Regulation of Florigen Transport in Rice Is Negatively Regulated by a Ubiquitin-like Domain Kinase OsUbDKγ4.	 Thus, dynamic modulation of OsFTIP1 abundance in leaves by a negative regulator OsUbDKγ4 is integral to the role of OsFTIP1 in mediating RFT1 transport in rice, and provide key evidence for a conserved role of FTIP1-like MCTPs in mediating florigen transport in flowering plants

OsMADS7|OsMADS45	OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a|RFT1	Ectopic expression of OsMADS45 activates the upstream genes Hd3a and RFT1 at an early development stage causing early flowering in rice.
