D3	Rcn1|OsABCG5	Genetic interaction between 2 tillering genes, reduced culm number 1 (rcn1) and tillering dwarf gene d3, in rice	The reduction in tillering by the rcn1 mutation was independent of the d3 genotype, and tillering number of d3rcn1 double mutant was between those of the d3 and rcn1 mutants
D3	Rcn1|OsABCG5	Genetic interaction between 2 tillering genes, reduced culm number 1 (rcn1) and tillering dwarf gene d3, in rice	These results demonstrated that the Rcn1 gene was not involved in the D3-associated pathway in tillering control

Rcn1|OsABCG5	RCN2	Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice	To investigate the possibility of similar mechanisms operating in the control of inflorescence architecture in rice, we analysed the functions of RCN1 and RCN2, rice TFL1/CEN homologs
Rcn1|OsABCG5	RCN2	Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice	Constitutive overexpression of RCN1 or RCN2 in Arabidopsis caused a late-flowering and highly branching phenotype, indicating that they possess conserved biochemical functions as TFL1
Rcn1|OsABCG5	RCN2	Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice	In 35S::RCN1 and 35S::RCN2 transgenic rice plants, the delay of transition to the reproductive phase was observed
Rcn1|OsABCG5	RCN2	Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice	Overexpression ofRCN1andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice
ETR2|Os-ERL1|OsETR2	Rcn1|OsABCG5	The ethylene receptor ETR2 delays floral transition and affects starch accumulation in rice	The GIGANTEA and TERMINAL FLOWER1/CENTRORADIALIS homolog (RCN1) that cause delayed flowering were upregulated in ETR2-overexpressing plants but downregulated in the etr2 mutant
OsXylT|RCN11	Rcn1|OsABCG5	The rice REDUCED CULM NUMBER11 gene controls vegetative growth under low-temperature conditions in paddy fields independent of RCN1/OsABCG5.	Since the shoot architecture of the rcn11 was very similar to that of the rcn1, we examined whether RCN11 is involved in RCN1/OsABCG5-associated vegetative growth control
OsXylT|RCN11	Rcn1|OsABCG5	The rice REDUCED CULM NUMBER11 gene controls vegetative growth under low-temperature conditions in paddy fields independent of RCN1/OsABCG5.	A genetic allelism test and molecular mapping study showed that rcn11 is independent of rcn1 on rice chromosome 3 and located on chromosome 8
OsXylT|RCN11	Rcn1|OsABCG5	The rice REDUCED CULM NUMBER11 gene controls vegetative growth under low-temperature conditions in paddy fields independent of RCN1/OsABCG5.	The rcn1 rcn11 phenotype suggests that RCN11 acts on vegetative growth independent of RCN1/OsABCG5
OsXylT|RCN11	Rcn1|OsABCG5	The rice REDUCED CULM NUMBER11 gene controls vegetative growth under low-temperature conditions in paddy fields independent of RCN1/OsABCG5.	A root development comparison between rcn1 and rcn11 in young seedlings represented that rcn11 reduced crown root number and elongation, whereas rcn1 reduced lateral root density and elongation
OsSPL9	Rcn1|OsABCG5	OsSPL9 Regulates Grain Number and Grain Yield in Rice	 By combining expression analysis and dual-luciferase assays, we further confirmed that OsSPL9 directly activates the expression of RCN1 (rice TERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIS homolog) in the early developing young panicle to regulate the panicle branches and GNP
Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8|CAR8|OsNF-YB11	Rcn1|OsABCG5	DTH8 overexpression induces early flowering, boosts yield, and improves stress recovery in rice cv IR64.	 DTH8 up-regulates the transcription of RFT1, Hd3a, GHD7, MOC1, and RCN1 in IR64 at the pre-flowering stage and plays a role in early flowering, increased number of tillers, enhanced panicle branching, and improved tolerance towards drought and salinity stress at the reproductive stage
OsCEN2	Rcn1|OsABCG5	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 Here, we report that the rice CENTRORADIALIS (CEN) family member OsCEN2 (also known as Rice TFL1/CEN homolog, RCN1), a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family protein, negatively controls grain size in rice
