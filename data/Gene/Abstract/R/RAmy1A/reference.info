1-s2.0-S0014579398000672-main.pdf	Functional dissection of a sugar-repressed α-amylase gene (RAmy1A) promoter in rice embryos	1998	FEBS Letters	Bioscience Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan	The gibberellin-inducible rice α-amylase gene, RAmy1A, was demonstrated to be sugar repressed in rice embryos and functional dissection of the promoter of RAmy1A in relation of its sugar-modulated expression was performed. Gibberellin-response cis-elements of GARE (TAACAAA) and pyrimidine box (CCTTTT) were partially involved in the sugar repression.

Previous analyses suggest that the key events controlling the GA-regulated gene expression in the aleurone are formation of active transcription machinery referred to as the GA responsive complex, followed by recruiting GAMYB. In general, bipartite promoter contexts composed of the GA-responsive element and the pyrimidine box are observed within the regulatory regions of cereal GA-responsive genes. Protein factors that recognize each promoter sequence were identified and distinct effects on the GA-mediated activation of gene expression have been also investigated; however, the connection and intercalation between two promoter motifs remain obscure. In this study, I have evaluated cooperative function of GAMYB and a pyrimidine box-binding protein OsDOF3 that influenced the promoter activity of the most predominant GA-responsive gene (RAmy1A) of rice (Oryza sativa). Transient expression of OsDOF3 in the germinated aleurone prolonged GAMYB function on the reporter expression in the absence of GA. The synergistic effect required a set of DNA bindings of two proteins on the RAmy1A promoter region. The yeast two-hybrid assay showed the physical interaction of GAMYB and OsDOF3 in yeast cells, indicating that the association of GAMYB and OsDOF3 may be a functional unit in transcription regulation. The results showed the accessory function of OsDOF3 responsible for a dosage-dependent mediation of GA signaling that leads to high-level expression of physiological target genes.
j.1365-313X.2003.01753.x.pdf	Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds	2003	The Plant Journal	Department of Biological Sciences, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Minami-ohsawa 1-1, Hachioji-shi, Tokyo 192-0397, Japan.	In germinating rice seeds, a cysteine proteinase (REP-1), synthesized in aleurone-layer cells, is a key enzyme in the degradation of the major storage protein, glutelin. The expression of the gene for REP-1 (Rep1) is induced by gibberellins (GAs) and repressed by abscisic acid (ABA). To identify GA-responsive elements in the Rep1 promoter, we developed a transient expression system in rice aleurone cells. Deletion and point-mutation analyses indicated that the GA-response complex was composed of TAACAGA, TAACGTA, and two copies of CAACTC. The two former sequences were identical to GAREs conserved in the promoter of genes for alpha-amylase and proteinases in cereals. The latter, termed as CAACTC regulatory elements (CAREs), were novel GAREs. Gain-of-function experiments revealed that two pairs of GARE and CARE were necessary and sufficient to confer GA inducibility. The sequences were also required for effective transactivation by the transcription factor OsGAMyb. Four copies of either GARE or CARE showed transactivation neither by OsGAMyb nor by GA induction. CARE and GARE were also found in the promoters of a rice alpha-amylase gene, RAmy1A, and a barley proteinase gene, EPB1, which are expressed in germinating seeds. Mutations of CARE in their promoters caused a loss of GA inducibility and GAMyb transactivation, suggesting that CARE is the regulatory element for GA-inducible expression of hydrolase genes in the germinating seeds.
Mol. Plant-2013-Schmidt-mp-sst131.pdf	SALT-RESPONSIVE ERF1 Is a Negative Regulator of Grain Filling and Gibberellin-Mediated Seedling Establishment in Rice	2014	Mol Plant	Institute of Biochemistry and Biology, University of Potsdam, Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 24-25, 14476 Potsdam, Germany	Grain quality is an important agricultural trait that is mainly determined by grain size and composition. Here, we characterize the role of the rice transcription factor (TF) SALT-RESPONSIVE ERF1 (SERF1) during grain development. Through genome-wide expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that SERF1 directly regulates RICE PROLAMIN-BOX BINDING FACTOR (RPBF), a TF that functions as a positive regulator of grain filling. Loss of SERF1 enhances RPBF expression resulting in larger grains with increased starch content, while SERF1 overexpression represses RPBF resulting in smaller grains. Consistently, during grain filling, starch biosynthesis genes such as GRANULE-BOUND STARCH SYNTHASEI (GBSSI), STARCH SYNTHASEI (SSI), SSIIIa, and ADP-GLUCOSE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE LARGE SUBUNIT2 (AGPL2) are up-regulated in SERF1 knockout grains. Moreover, SERF1 is a direct upstream regulator of GBSSI. In addition, SERF1 negatively regulates germination by controlling RPBF expression, which mediates the gibberellic acid (GA)-induced expression of RICE AMYLASE1A (RAmy1A). Loss of SERF1 results in more rapid seedling establishment, while SERF1 overexpression has the opposite effect. Our study reveals that SERF1 represents a negative regulator of grain filling and seedling establishment by timing the expression of RPBF.
Plant Cell Physiol-2005-Asatsuma-858-69.pdf	Involvement of alpha-amylase I-1 in starch degradation in rice chloroplasts	2005	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratories of Plant and Microbial Genome Control, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Niigata University, Niigata, 950-2181 Japan.	To determine the role of alpha-amylase isoform I-1 in the degradation of starch in rice leaf chloroplasts, we generated a series of transgenic rice plants with suppressed expression or overexpression of alpha-amylase I-1. In the lines with suppressed expression of alpha-amylase I-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels, seed germination and seedling growth were markedly delayed in comparison with those in the wild-type plants. However, the growth retardation was overcome by supplementation of sugars. Interestingly, a significant increase of starch accumulation in the young leaf tissues was observed under a sugar-supplemented condition. In contrast, the starch content of leaves was reduced in the plants overexpressing alpha-amylase I-1. In immunocytochemical analysis with specific anti-alpha-amylase I-1 antiserum, immuno-gold particles deposited in the chloroplasts and extracellular space in young leaf cells. We further examined the expression and targeting of alpha-amylase I-1 fused with the green fluorescent protein in re-differentiated green cells, and showed that the fluorescence of the expressed fusion protein co-localized with the chlorophyll autofluorescence in the transgenic cells. In addition, mature protein species of alpha-amylase I-1 bearing an oligosaccharide side chain were detected in the isolated chloroplasts. Based on these results, we concluded that alpha-amylase I-1 targets the chloroplasts through the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi system and plays a significant role in the starch degradation in rice leaves.
tpc2102844.pdf	The rice alpha-amylase glycoprotein is targeted from the Golgi apparatus through the secretory pathway to the plastids	2009	Plant Cell	Graduate School of Science and Technology, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.	The well-characterized secretory glycoprotein, rice (Oryza sativa) alpha-amylase isoform I-1 (AmyI-1), was localized within the plastids and proved to be involved in the degradation of starch granules in the organelles of rice cells. In addition, a large portion of transiently expressed AmyI-1 fused to green fluorescent protein (AmyI-1-GFP) colocalized with a simultaneously expressed fluorescent plastid marker in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells. The plastid targeting of AmyI-1 was inhibited by both dominant-negative and constitutively active mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana ARF1 and Arabidopsis SAR1, which arrest endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi traffic. In cells expressing fluorescent trans-Golgi and plastid markers, these fluorescent markers frequently colocalized when coexpressed with AmyI-1. Three-dimensional time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy of high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted cells demonstrated that contact of the Golgi-derived membrane vesicles with cargo and subsequent absorption into plastids occur within the cells. The transient expression of a series of C-terminal-truncated AmyI-1-GFP fusion proteins in the onion cell system showed that the region from Trp-301 to Gln-369 is necessary for plastid targeting of AmyI-1. Furthermore, the results obtained by site-directed mutations of Trp-302 and Gly-354, located on the surface and on opposite sides of the AmyI-1 protein, suggest that multiple surface regions are necessary for plastid targeting. Thus, Golgi-to-plastid traffic appears to be involved in the transport of glycoproteins to plastids and plastid targeting seems to be accomplished in a sorting signal-dependent manner.
NA	Senescence-Specific Expression of RAmy1A Accelerates Non-structural Carbohydrate Remobilization and Grain Filling in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Front Plant Sci	Longping Branch of Graduate School, Hunan University, Changsha, China.	Remobilization of pre-anthesis NSCs (non-structural carbohydrates) is significant for effective grain filling in rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, abundant starch particles as an important component of NSCs are still present in the leaf sheath and stem at the late stage of grain filling. There are no studies on how bioengineering techniques can be used to improve the efficiency of NSC remobilization. In this study, RAmy1A was expressed under the senescence-specific promoter of SAG12, which was designed to degrade starch in the leaf sheath and stem during grain filling. RAmy1A mRNA successfully accumulated in the leaf, stem, and sheath of transgenic plants after anthesis. At the same time, the starch and total soluble sugar content in the leaf, stem, and leaf sheath were obviously decreased during the grain-filling period. The photosynthetic rate of transgenic lines was higher than that of the wild types by an average of 4.0 and 9.9%, at 5 and 10 days after flowering, respectively. In addition, the grain-filling rate of transgenic lines was faster than that of the wild types by an average of 26.09%. These results indicate an enhanced transport efficiency of NSCs from source tissues in transgenic rice. Transgenic rice also displayed accelerated leaf senescence, which was hypothesized to contribute to decreased grain weight.
