Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	OsCERK1	The Hop/Sti1-Hsp90 chaperone complex facilitates the maturation and transport of a PAMP receptor in rice innate immunity	We find that the rice chitin receptor OsCERK1 interacts with Hsp90 and its cochaperone Hop/Sti1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	OsCERK1	The Hop/Sti1-Hsp90 chaperone complex facilitates the maturation and transport of a PAMP receptor in rice innate immunity	Hop/Sti1 and Hsp90 are required for efficient transport of OsCERK1 from the ER to the plasma membrane (PM) via a pathway dependent on Sar1, a small GTPase which regulates ER-to-Golgi trafficking
Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	OsRac1	The Hop/Sti1-Hsp90 chaperone complex facilitates the maturation and transport of a PAMP receptor in rice innate immunity	Further, Hop/Sti1 and Hsp90 are present at the PM in a complex (designated the "defensome") with OsRac1, a plant-specific Rho-type GTPase

Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	OsRac1	RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice	Studies with Os RAR1-RNAi and treatment with geldanamycin, an HSP90-specific inhibitor, showed that RAR1 and HSP90 are essential for the Rac1-mediated enhancement of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune responses in rice cell cultures
Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	OsRac1	RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice	Furthermore, the function of HSP90, but not RAR1, may be essential for their association with the Rac1 complex
Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	OsRac1	RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice	Together, our results indicate that Rac1, RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 form one or more protein complexes in rice cells and suggest that these proteins play important roles in innate immunity in rice
Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	OsRAR1	RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice	RAR1 (for required for Mla12 resistance) and HSP90 (a heat shock protein 90 kD) are important components of R gene-mediated disease resistance, and their function is conserved in several plant species
