The Rirlb gene of rice (Oryza sativa) is one of a set of putative defense genes whose transcripts accumulate upon inoculation of rice with the non-host pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. It belongs to a family of genes encoding small extracellular proteins so far only identified in cereals. To assess the function of the Rirlb gene in rice blast resistance, it was placed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and transferred into rice plants of the japonica variety Taipei 309 by biolistic transformation of immature embryos. Two out of 12 hygromycin-resistant regenerated plants (OE1 and OE3) were fertile. DNA gel blot analysis suggested that these two T0 plants were independent transformants, each of which had stably incorporated one complete copy of the transgene into the genome. In addition, the OE1 plant appeared also a contain a rearranged copy or incomplete copy. T1 plants homozygous for the transgene were identified by DNA gel blot analysis of individual T2 progeny and further propagated. Expression analysis of the transgene showed that the transgene was active both in T1 plants and homozygous decendants. Challenge inoculation of homozygous transgenic plants with Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, revealed that both independent transgenic lines were more resistant than the untransformed wild type, suggesting that over-expression of the Rirlb gene confers partial resistance against this important pathogen.
