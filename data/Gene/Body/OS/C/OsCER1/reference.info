Plant-2008-Zhang-599-610.pdf	Tapetum degeneration retardation is critical for aliphatic metabolism and gene regulation during rice pollen development	2008	Mol Plant	Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, China.	As a complex wall system in flowering plants, the pollen outer wall mainly contains aliphatic sporopollenin; however, the mechanism for synthesizing these lipidic precursors during pollen development remains less well understood. Here, we report on the function of the rice tapetum-expressing TDR (Tapetum Degeneration Retardation) gene in aliphatic metabolism and its regulatory role during rice pollen development. The observations of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses suggested that pollen wall formation was significantly altered in the tdr mutant. The contents of aliphatic compositions of anther were greatly changed in the tdr mutant revealed by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) testing, particularly less accumulated in fatty acids, primary alcohols, alkanes and alkenes, and an abnormal increase in secondary alcohols with carbon lengths from C29 to C35 in tdr. Microarray data revealed that a group of genes putatively involved in lipid transport and metabolism were significantly altered in the tdr mutant, indicating the critical role of TDR in the formation of the pollen wall. Also, a wide range of genes (236 in total-154 up-regulated and 82 down-regulated) exhibited statistically significant expressional differences between wild-type and tdr. In addition to its function in promoting tapetum PCD, TDR possibly plays crucial regulatory roles in several basic biological processes during rice pollen development.
NA	OsCER1 Plays a Pivotal Role in Very-Long-Chain Alkane Biosynthesis and Affects Plastid Development and Programmed Cell Death of Tapetum in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2018	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources - Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Biotechnology of Guangdong Provincial Higher Education Institutions, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.	Cuticle waxes, which are primarily comprised of very-long-chain (VLC) alkanes, play an important role in plant reproductive development. ECERIFERUM1 (CER1) is recognized as the core element for VLC alkane biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). However, genes involved in the VLC alkane biosynthesis in rice remain unclear, and the alkane-form pathway in rice has still to be further explored. Here, we show that OsCER1, a homology of CER1, functions in VLC alkanes biosynthesis, which also could regulate anther development and plastids differentiation in rice. OsCER1 was highly expressed in the tapetum (stage 10) and bicellular pollen cells (stage 11). The decreased content of VLC alkanes (C25 and C27) in the OsCER1 knocked down plants as well as the increased content of C27 alkanes in the OsCER1 overexpression plants indicates that OsCER1 participates in VLC alkane biosynthesis. Downregulation of OsCER1 in rice led to sterility, and fewer amyloplasts within the mature pollen grains. In addition, the downregulation of OsCER1 in rice caused delayed tapetal programmed cell death and abnormal development of plastids in the tapetal cells. Furthermore, significantly altered levels of expression of genes involved in the pollen development were exhibited in the OsCER1 knocked down plants. These results indicate that OsCER1 is critical for VLC alkanes biosynthesis, plastids differentiation, and pollen development. This work provides insights into the VLC alkanes biosynthesis in anther development in rice.
NA	Deficiency of very-long-chain alkanes biosynthesis causes humidity-sensitive male sterility via affecting pollen adhesion and hydration in rice.	2019	Plant Cell Environ	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Pollen adhesion and hydration are the earliest events of the pollen-stigma interactions which allow compatible pollen to fertilize egg cells, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Rice pollen are wind dispersed, and its pollen coat contains less abundant lipids than that of insect-pollinated plants. Here, we characterized the role of OsGL1-4, a rice member of the Glossy family, in pollen adhesion and hydration. OsGL1-4 is preferentially expressed in pollen and tapetal cells, and is required for the synthesis of very-long-chain alkanes. osgl1-4 mutant generated apparently normal pollen, but displayed excessively fast dehydration at anthesis, and defective adhesion and hydration under normal condition, but the defective adhesion and hydration were rescued by high humidity. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis suggested the humidity-sensitive male sterility of osgl1-4 was probably due to a significant reduction in C25 and C27 alkanes. These results indicate that very-long-chain alkanes are components of rice pollen coat, and control male fertility via affecting pollen adhesion and hydration in response to environmental humidity. Moreover, we proposed that a critical point of water content in mature pollen is required for the initiation of pollen adhesion.
NA	OsCER1 regulates humidity-sensitive genic male sterility through very-long-chain (VLC) alkane metabolism of tryphine in rice	2021	Funct Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilisation of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Humidity-sensitive genic male sterility (HGMS) is a novel type of environment-sensitive male sterility (EGMS) which plants are male sterile at low humidity and male fertile at high humidity. Previous studies have revealed that OsCER1 contributes to very-long-chain (VLC) alkanes biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, applying the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, we obtained two independent OsCER1 knockout lines (OsCER1Cas). Both OsCER1Cas lines exhibited HGMS. Mutant pollen showed defects in adhesion and germination on stigmas at low humidity, whereas high humidity enhanced the pollen germination rate. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of mutant pollen revealed abnormal tryphine structure, potentially representing the basis of HGMS. Furthermore, co-pollination with mixed OsCER1Cas mutant and maize (Zea mays L.) pollen could rescue the fertility of the mutant, thereby establishing the key role of tryphine in germination on stigmas. OsCER1 knockout might affect VLC alkane metabolism and therefore alter the lipid composition of tryphine. It could lead to the defects in pollen grain adhesion, hydration and germination, resulting in HGMS. This work identified the mechanism of HGMS induced by VLC alkanes in rice and the generality of tryphine in different species of Gramineae.
