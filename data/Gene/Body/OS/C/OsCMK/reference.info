Okada-2007-Elicitor induced act.pdf	Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo, Japan.	Diterpenoid phytoalexins such as momilactones and phytocassanes are produced via geranylgeranyl diphosphate in suspension-cultured rice cells after treatment with a chitin elicitor. We have previously shown that the production of diterpene hydrocarbons leading to phytoalexins and the expression of related biosynthetic genes are activated in suspension-cultured rice cells upon elicitor treatment. To better understand the elicitor-induced activation of phytoalexin biosynthesis, we conducted microarray analysis using suspension-cultured rice cells collected at various times after treatment with chitin elicitor. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two types of early-induced expression (EIE-1, EIE-2) nodes and a late-induced expression (LIE) node that includes genes involved in phytoalexins biosynthesis. The LIE node contains genes that may be responsible for the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a plastidic biosynthetic pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate, an early precursor of phytoalexins. The elicitor-induced expression of these putative MEP pathway genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. 1-Deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D: -erythritol synthase (CMS), which catalyze the first three committed steps in the MEP pathway, were further shown to have enzymatic activities that complement the growth of E. coli mutants disrupted in the corresponding genes. Application of ketoclomazone and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of DXS and DXR, respectively, repressed the accumulation of diterpene-type phytoalexins in suspension cells treated with chitin elicitor. These results suggest that activation of the MEP pathway is required to supply sufficient terpenoid precursors for the production of phytoalexins in infected rice plants.
NA	A single nucleotide mutation of IspE gene participating in the MEP pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis causes green-revertible yellow leaf phenotype in rice.	2018	Plant Cell Physiol	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	Plant isoprenoids are dependent on two independent pathways, the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway and the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. IspE is one of seven known enzymes in the MEP pathway. Currently, no IspE gene has been identified in rice. In addition, no virescent mutants have been reported to result from a gene mutation affecting the MEP pathway. In this study, we isolated a green-revertible yellow leaf mutant gry340 in rice. The mutant exhibited a reduced level of photosynthetic pigments, and an arrested development of chloroplasts and mitochondria in its yellow leaves. Map-based cloning revealed a missense mutation in OsIspE (LOC_Os01g58790) in gry340 mutant plants. OsIspE is constitutively expressed in all tissues, and its encoded protein is targeted to the chloroplast. Further, the mutant phenotype of gry340 was rescued by introduction of the wild-type gene. Therefore, we have successfully identified an IspE gene in monocotyledons via map-based cloning, and confirmed that the green-revertible yellow leaf phenotype of gry340 does result from a single nucleotide mutation in the IspE gene. In addition, the ispE ispF double mutant displayed an etiolation lethal phenotype, indicating that the isoprenoid precursors from cytosol cannot efficiently compensate for the deficiency of the MEP pathway in rice chloroplasts. Furthermore, real-time quantitative RT-PCR suggested that this functional defect in OsIspE not only affected the expression of other MEP-pathway genes, but that of MVA-pathway genes, photosynthetic genes, and mitochondrial genes.
