Su-2006-The N-terminal ATPas.pdf	The N-terminal ATPase AT-hook-containing region of the Arabidopsis chromatin-remodeling protein SPLAYED is sufficient for biological activity	2006	Plant J	Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6018, USA.	The SNF2-like chromatin-remodeling ATPase SPLAYED (SYD) was identified as a co-activator of floral homeotic gene expression in Arabidopsis. SYD is also required for meristem maintenance and regulates flowering under a non-inductive photoperiod. SNF2 ATPases are structurally and functionally conserved from yeast to humans. In addition to the conserved protein features, SYD has a large unique C-terminal domain. We show here that SYD is present as two forms in the nucleus, full-length and truncated, with the latter apparently lacking the C-terminal domain. The ratio of the two forms of endogenous SYD differs in juvenile and in adult tissues. Furthermore, an SYD variant lacking the C-terminal domain (SYDDeltaC) rescues the syd null mutant, indicating that the N-terminal ATPase AT-hook-containing region of SYD is sufficient for biological activity. Plants expressing SYDDeltaC show molecular and morphological phenotypes opposite to those of the null mutant, suggesting that the construct results in increased activity. This increased activity is at least in part due to elevated SYD protein levels in these lines. We propose that the C-terminal domain may control SYD accumulation and/or specific activity in the context of the full-length protein. The presence of the C-terminal domain in rice SYD suggests that its role is probably conserved in the two classes of flowering plants.
