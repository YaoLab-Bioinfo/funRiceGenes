2052.pdf	Knockdown of a rice stelar nitrate transporter alters long-distance translocation but not root influx	2012	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement and Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Root nitrate uptake is well known to adjust to the plant's nitrogen demand for growth. Long-distance transport and/or root storage pools are thought to provide negative feedback signals regulating root uptake. We have characterized a vascular specific nitrate transporter belonging to the high-affinity Nitrate Transporter2 (NRT2) family, OsNRT2.3a, in rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica 'Nipponbare'). Localization analyses using protoplast expression, in planta promoter-beta-glucuronidase assay, and in situ hybridization showed that OsNRT2.3a was located in the plasma membrane and mainly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of the stele of nitrate-supplied roots. Knockdown expression of OsNRT2.3a by RNA interference (RNAi) had impaired xylem loading of nitrate and decreased plant growth at low (0.5 mm) nitrate supply. In comparison with the wild type, the RNAi lines contained both nitrate and total nitrogen significantly higher in the roots and lower in the shoots. The short-term [(15)N]NO(3)(-) influx (5 min) in entire roots and NO(3)(-) fluxes in root surfaces showed that the knockdown of OsNRT2.3a in comparison with the wild type did not affect nitrate uptake by roots. The RNAi plants showed no significant changes in the expression of some root nitrate transporters (OsNRT2.3b, OsNRT2.4, and OsNAR2.1), but transcripts for nia1 (nitrate reductase) had increased and OsNRT2.1 and OsNRT2.2 had decreased when the plants were supplied with nitrate. Taken together, the data demonstrate that OsNRT2.3a plays a key role in long-distance nitrate transport from root to shoot at low nitrate supply level in rice.
NA	The indica nitrate reductase gene OsNR2 allele enhances rice yield potential and nitrogen use efficiency.	2019	Nat Commun	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, 310006, China.	The indica and japonica rice (Oryza sativa) subspecies differ in nitrate (NO3-) assimilation capacity and nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE). Here, we show that a major component of this difference is conferred by allelic variation at OsNR2, a gene encoding a NADH/NADPH-dependent NO3- reductase (NR). Selection-driven allelic divergence has resulted in variant indica and japonica OsNR2 alleles encoding structurally distinct OsNR2 proteins, with indica OsNR2 exhibiting greater NR activity. Indica OsNR2 also promotes NO3- uptake via feed-forward interaction with OsNRT1.1B, a gene encoding a NO3- uptake transporter. These properties enable indica OsNR2 to confer increased effective tiller number, grain yield and NUE on japonica rice, effects enhanced by interaction with an additionally introgressed indica OsNRT1.1B allele. In consequence, indica OsNR2 provides an important breeding resource for the sustainable increases in japonica rice yields necessary for future global food security.
NA	New Insights into the Transcriptional Regulation of Genes Involved in the Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Potassium Chlorate in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Department of Southern Area Crop Science, National Institute of Crop Science, RDA, Miryang 50424, Korea.	Potassium chlorate (KClO3) has been widely used to evaluate the divergence in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) between indica and japonica rice subspecies. This study investigated the transcriptional regulation of major genes involved in the NUE in rice treated with KClO3, which acts as an inhibitor of the reducing activity of nitrate reductase (NR) in higher plants. A set of two KClO3 sensitive nitrate reductase (NR) and two nitrate transporter (NRT) introgression rice lines (BC2F7), carrying the indica alleles of NR or NRT, derived from a cross between Saeilmi (japonica, P1) and Milyang23 (indica, P2), were exposed to KClO3 at the seedling stage. The phenotypic responses were recorded 7 days after treatment, and samples for gene expression, physiological, and biochemical analyses were collected at 0 h (control) and 3 h after KClO3 application. The results revealed that Saeilmi (P1, japonica) and Milyang23 (P2, indica) showed distinctive phenotypic responses. In addition, the expression of OsNR2 was differentially regulated between the roots, stem, and leaf tissues, and between introgression lines. When expressed in the roots, OsNR2 was downregulated in all introgression lines. However, in the stem and leaves, OsNR2 was upregulated in the NR introgression lines, but downregulation in the NRT introgression lines. In the same way, the expression patterns of OsNIA1 and OsNIA2 in the roots, stem, and leaves indicated a differential transcriptional regulation by KClO3, with OsNIA2 prevailing over OsNIA1 in the roots. Under the same conditions, the activity of NR was inhibited in the roots and differentially regulated in the stem and leaf tissues. Furthermore, the transcriptional divergence of OsAMT1.3 and OsAMT2.3, OsGLU1 and OsGLU2, between NR and NRT, coupled with the NR activity pattern in the roots, would indicate the prevalence of nitrate (NO3бе) transport over ammonium (NH4+) transport. Moreover, the induction of catalase (CAT) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme activities in Saeilmi (P1, KClO3 resistant), and the decrease in Milyang23 (P2, KClO3 sensitive), coupled with the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, indicated the extent of the oxidative stress, and the induction of the adaptive response mechanism, tending to maintain a balanced reduction-oxidation state in response to KClO3. The changes in the chloroplast pigments and proline content propose these compounds as emerging biomarkers for assessing the overall plant health status. These results suggest that the inhibitory potential of KClO3 on the reduction activity of the nitrate reductase (NR), as well as that of the genes encoding the nitrate and ammonium transporters, and glutamate synthase are tissue-specific, which may differentially affect the transport and assimilation of nitrate or ammonium in rice.
