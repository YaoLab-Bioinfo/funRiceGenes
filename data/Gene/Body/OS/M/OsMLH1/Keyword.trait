OsMLH1	development	Rice MutL¦Ã, the MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer, participates in the formation of type I crossovers and regulation of embryo sac fertility	 OsMLH3 and OsMLH1 (MutL-homolog 1) interact to form a heterodimer (MutL¦Ã) to promote crossover formation in the macrospore and microspore mother cells and development of functional megaspore during meiosis, defective OsMLH3 or OsMLH1 in fsv1 and CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout lines results in reduced type I crossover and bivalent frequency
OsMLH1	microspore	Rice MutL¦Ã, the MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer, participates in the formation of type I crossovers and regulation of embryo sac fertility	 OsMLH3 and OsMLH1 (MutL-homolog 1) interact to form a heterodimer (MutL¦Ã) to promote crossover formation in the macrospore and microspore mother cells and development of functional megaspore during meiosis, defective OsMLH3 or OsMLH1 in fsv1 and CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout lines results in reduced type I crossover and bivalent frequency
