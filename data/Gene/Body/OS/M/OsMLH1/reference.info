Mismatch repair (MMR) is a conservative pathway for maintaining the genome integrity of different organisms. Although suppression of MMR has resulted in various mutation phenotypes in Arabidopsis, the use of this strategy for mutation breeding in major crops has not been reported. Here, we overexpressed a truncated version of the OsPMS1 protein in rice; this approach is expected to suppress the rice MMR system through a dominant negative mechanism. We observed a wide spectrum of mutation phenotypes in the progeny of the transgenic plants during seed germination and the plant growth stages. Genomic variations were detected with inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR), and sequencing of the differential ISSR bands revealed that the mutation occurred as a point mutation or as microsatellite instability at high frequencies. Plant lines with agronomically important traits, such as salt and drought tolerance, various tiller number, and early flowering, were obtained. Furthermore, we obtained mutants with important traits that are free of the transgene. Together, these results demonstrate that MMR suppression can be used as an efficient strategy for mutation breeding in rice.
NA	Rice MutL¦Ã, the MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer, participates in the formation of type I crossovers and regulation of embryo sac fertility	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, Changsha, China.	The development of embryo sacs is crucial for seed production in plants, but the genetic basis regulating the meiotic crossover formation in the macrospore and microspore mother cells remains largely unclear. Here, we report the characterization of a spontaneous rice female sterile variation 1 mutant (fsv1) that showed severe embryo sacs abortion with low seed-setting rate. Through map-based cloning and functional analyses, we isolated the causal gene of fsv1, OsMLH3 encoding a MutL-homolog 3 protein, an ortholog of HvMLH3 in barley and AtMLH3 in Arabidopsis. OsMLH3 and OsMLH1 (MutL-homolog 1) interact to form a heterodimer (MutL¦Ã) to promote crossover formation in the macrospore and microspore mother cells and development of functional megaspore during meiosis, defective OsMLH3 or OsMLH1 in fsv1 and CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout lines results in reduced type I crossover and bivalent frequency. The fsv1 and OsMLH3-knockout lines are valuable germplasms for development of female sterile restorer lines for mechanized seed production of hybrid rice.
