Cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and a number of other proteins control the progression of plant cell cycle. Although extensive studies have revealed the roles of some cell cycle regulators and the underlying mechanisms in Arabidopsis, relatively a small number of cell cycle regulators were functionally analyzed in rice. In this study, we describe 41 regulators in the rice genome. Our results indicate that the rice genome contains a less number of the core cell cycle regulators than the Arabidopsis one does, although the rice genome is much larger than the Arabidopsis one. Eight groups of CDKs similar to those in Arabidopsis were identified in the rice genome through phylogenetic analysis, and the corresponding members in the different groups include E2F, CKI, Rb, CKS and Wee. The structures of the core cell regulators were relatively conserved between the rice and Arabidopsis genomes. Furthermore, the expression of the majority of the core cell cycle genes was spatially regulated, and the most closely related ones showed very similar patterns of expression, suggesting functional redundancy and conservation between the highly similar core cell cycle genes in rice and Arabidopsis. Following auxin or cytokinin treatment, the expression of the core cell cycle genes was either upregulated or downregulated, suggesting that auxin and/or cytokinin may directly regulate the expression of the core cell cycle genes. Our results provide basic information to understand the mechanism of cell cycle regulation and the functions of the rice cell cycle genes.
