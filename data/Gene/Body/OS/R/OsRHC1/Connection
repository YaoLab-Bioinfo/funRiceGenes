GE|CYP78A13	OsRHC1|LE	Identification and Characterization of LARGE EMBRYO, a New Gene Controlling Embryo Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	Three giant embryo mutants, including large embryo (le), giant embryo (ge) and super-giant embryo (ges), with variable embryo size were used in this study
GE|CYP78A13	OsRHC1|LE	Identification and Characterization of LARGE EMBRYO, a New Gene Controlling Embryo Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 We investigated whether genes controlling embryo size in these mutants (le, ge and ges) were allelic to each other
GE|CYP78A13	OsRHC1|LE	Identification and Characterization of LARGE EMBRYO, a New Gene Controlling Embryo Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Although ge and ges was allelic to GIANT EMBRY (GE), le was not allelic to ge and ges in allelism test
GE|CYP78A13	OsRHC1|LE	Identification and Characterization of LARGE EMBRYO, a New Gene Controlling Embryo Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 However, the GE gene of the le mutant did not carry any mutation, suggesting that the enlarged embryo phenotype of le was governed by another gene
