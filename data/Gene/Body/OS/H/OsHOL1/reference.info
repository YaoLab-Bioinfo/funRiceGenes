Almost all of the chlorine-containing gas emitted from natural sources is methyl chloride (CH(3)Cl), which contributes to the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer. Tropical and subtropical plants emit substantial amounts of CH(3)Cl. A gene involved in CH(3)Cl emission from Arabidopsis was previously identified and designated HARMLESS TO OZONE LAYER (hereafter AtHOL1) based on the mutant phenotype. Our previous studies demonstrated that AtHOL1 and its homologs, AtHOL2 and AtHOL3, have S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase activities. However, the physiological functions of AtHOLs have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, our comparative kinetic analyses with possible physiological substrates indicated that all of the AtHOLs have low activities toward chloride. AtHOL1 was highly reactive to thiocyanate (NCS(-)), a pseudohalide, synthesizing methylthiocyanate (CH(3)SCN) with a very high k(cat)/K(m) value. We demonstrated in vivo that substantial amounts of NCS(-) were synthesized upon tissue damage in Arabidopsis and that NCS(-) was largely derived from myrosinase-mediated hydrolysis of glucosinolates. Analyses with the T-DNA insertion Arabidopsis mutants (hol1, hol2, and hol3) revealed that only hol1 showed increased sensitivity to NCS(-) in medium and a concomitant lack of CH(3)SCN synthesis upon tissue damage. Bacterial growth assays indicated that the conversion of NCS(-) into CH(3)SCN dramatically increased antibacterial activities against Arabidopsis pathogens that normally invade the wound site. Furthermore, hol1 seedlings showed an increased susceptibility toward an Arabidopsis pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola. Here we propose that AtHOL1 is involved in glucosinolate metabolism and defense against phytopathogens. Moreover, CH(3)Cl synthesized by AtHOL1 could be considered a byproduct of NCS(-) metabolism.
NA	Targeted knockout of the gene OsHOL1 removes methyl iodide emissions from rice plants	2021	Scientific Reports	PlantLab, Institute of Life Sciences, Scuola Superiore Sant¡¯Anna, Pisa, Italy	Iodine deficiency represents a public health problem worldwide. To increase the amount of iodine in the diet, biofortification strategies of plants have been tried. They rely on the exogenous administration of iodine to increase its absorption and accumulation. However, iodine is not stable in plants and can be volatilized as methyl iodide through the action of specific methyltransferases encoded by the HARMLESS TO OZONE LAYER (HOL) genes. The release of methyl iodide in the atmosphere represents a threat for the environment due to its ozone depletion potential. Rice paddies are among the strongest producers of methyl iodide. Thus, the agronomic approach of iodine biofortification is not appropriate for this crop, leading to further increases of iodine emissions. In this work, we used the genome editing CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knockout the rice HOL genes and investigate their function. OsHOL1 resulted a major player in methyl iodide production, since its knockout abolished the process. Moreover, its overexpression reinforced it. Conversely, knockout of OsHOL2 did not produce effects. Our experiments helped elucidating the function of the rice HOL genes, providing tools to develop new rice varieties with reduced iodine emissions and thus more suitable for biofortification programs without further impacting on the environment.
