The production of transgenic plants has contributed greatly to plant research. Previously, an improved method for screening transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seeds using the FAST (Fluorescence-Accumulating-Seed Technology) method and FAST marker was reported. Arabidopsis seeds containing the FAST marker may be visually screened using a fluorescence stereomicroscope or blue LED handy-type instrument. Although the FAST method was originally designed for Arabidopsis screens, this study endeavors to adapt this method for the screening of other plants. Here, an optimized technology, designated the OsFAST method, is presented as a useful tool for screening transgenic rice seeds. The OsFAST method is based on the expression of the OsFAST-G marker under the control of a seed-embryo-specific promoter, similar to the Arabidopsis FAST-G marker. The OsFAST method provides a simple and non-destructive method for identifying transgenic rice seeds. It is proposed that the FAST method is adaptable to various plant species and will enable a deeper analysis of the floral-dip method.
