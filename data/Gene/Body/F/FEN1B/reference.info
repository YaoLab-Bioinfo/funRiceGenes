Flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) is an important enzyme involved in DNA replication and repair. Previously, we isolated and characterized a complementary DNA (cDNA) from rice (Oryza sativa) encoding a protein which shows homology with the eukaryotic flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1). In this report, we found that rice (O. sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) possessed two FEN-1 homologues designated as OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b. The OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b genes were mapped to chromosome 5 and 3, respectively. Both genes contained 17 exons and 16 introns. Alignment of OsFEN-1a protein with OsFEN-1b protein showed a high degree of sequence similarity, particularly around the N and I domains. Northern hybridization and in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated preferential expression of OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b in proliferating tissues such as the shoot apical meristem or young leaves. The levels of OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b expression were significantly reduced when cell proliferation was temporarily halted by the removal of sucrose from the growth medium. When the growth-halted cells began to regrow following the addition of sucrose to the medium, both OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b were again expressed at high level. These results suggested that OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b are required for cell proliferation. Functional complementation assay suggested that OsFEN-1a cDNA had the ability to complement Saccharomyces cerevisiae rad27 null mutant. On the other hand, OsFEN-1b cDNA could not complement the rad27 mutant. The roles of OsFEN-1a and OsFEN-1b in plant DNA replication and repair are discussed.
