Higuchi-Takeuchi-2011-Functional analysis.pdf	Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis	2011	Plant Physiol	Plant Functional Genomics Research Group, RIKEN, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan.	Ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase (FNR) mediates electron transfer between ferredoxin (Fd) and NADP(+); therefore, it is a key enzyme that provides the reducing power used in the Calvin cycle. Other than FNR, nitrite reductase, sulfite reductase, glutamate synthase, and Fd-thioredoxin reductase also accept electrons from Fd, an electron carrier protein in the stroma. Therefore, the regulation of electron partitioning in the chloroplast is important for photosynthesis and other metabolic pathways. The regulatory mechanism of electron partitioning, however, remains to be elucidated. We found, by taking advantage of a gain-of-function approach, that expression of two rice (Oryza sativa) full-length cDNAs of leaf-type FNRs (OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2) led to altered chlorophyll fluorescence and growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice. We revealed that overexpression of the OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2 full-length cDNAs resulted in distinct phenotypes despite the high sequence similarity between them. Expression of OsLFNR1 affected the nitrogen assimilation pathway without inhibition of photosynthesis under normal conditions. On the other hand, OsLFNR2 expression led to the impairment of photosynthetic linear electron transport as well as Fd-dependent cyclic electron flow around photosystem I. The endogenous protein level of OsLFNR was found to be suppressed in both OsLFNR1- and OsLFNR2-overexpressing rice plants, leading to changes in the stoichiometry of the two LFNR isoforms within the thylakoid and soluble fractions. Thus, we propose that the stoichiometry of two LFNR isoforms plays an important role in electron partitioning between carbon fixation and nitrogen assimilation.
NA	Primary Leaf-type Ferredoxin1 Participates in Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Carbon Assimilation in Rice.	2020	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute,  Hangzhou, 310006, China.	Ferredoxins (Fd) play a crucial role in photosynthesis by regulating the distribution of electrons to downstream enzymes. Multiple Fd genes have been annotated in the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome; however, their specific functions are not well understood. Here, we report the functional characterization of rice  Fd1. Sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis of seven rice Fd proteins, and RT-qPCR analysis showed that rice Fd1 is a primary leaf-type Fd. Electron transfer assays involving NADP+ and cytochrome c indicated that Fd1 can donate electrons from photosystem I (PSI) to ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase. Loss-of-function fd1 mutants showed chlorosis and seedling lethality at the three-leaf stage. The deficiency of Fd1 impaired photosynthetic electron transport, which affected carbon assimilation. Exogenous glucose treatment partially restored the mutant phenotype, suggesting that Fd1 plays an important role in photosynthetic electron transport in rice. In addition, the transcript levels of Fd-dependent genes were affected in fd1 mutants, and the trend was similar to that observed in the fdc2 plants. Together, these results suggest that OsFd1 is the primary Fd in photosynthetic electron transport and carbon assimilation in rice.
