OsCBSX3	TLP|PR5	Over-Expression of Rice CBS Domain Containing Protein, OsCBSX3, Confers Rice Resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae Inoculation.	Consistently, the over-expression of OsCBSX3 enhances the transcript levels of immunity associated marker genes including PR1a, PR1b, PR5, AOS2, PAL, NH1, and OsWRKY13 in plants inoculated with M
OsWRKY4	TLP|PR5	Rice WRKY4 acts as a transcriptional activator mediating defense responses toward Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight.	Modulation of OsWRKY4 transcript levels by constitutive overexpression increases resistance to the necrotrophic sheath blight fungus, concomitant with elevated expression of JA- and ET-responsive pathogenesis-related (PR) genes such as PR1a, PR1b, PR5 and PR10/PBZ1
OsWRKY4	TLP|PR5	Rice WRKY4 acts as a transcriptional activator mediating defense responses toward Rhizoctonia solani, the causing agent of rice sheath blight.	Yeast one-hybrid assay and transient expression in tobacco cells reveal that OsWRKY4 specifically binds to the promoter regions of PR1b and PR5 which contain W-box (TTGAC[C/T]), or W-box like (TGAC[C/T]) cis-elements
OsDjA6	TLP|PR5	The DnaJ protein OsDjA6 negatively regulates rice innate immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	In addition, the expression levels of WRKY45, NPR1, and PR5 are increased in the OsDjA6 RNAi plants, indicating that OsDjA6 may mediate resistance by affecting the salicylic acid pathway
TLP|PR5	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	ERECT LEAF1 suppresses jasmonic acid response in rice by decreasing OsWRKY4 stability.	 These results suggest that ELF1 indirectly controls the expression of PR1b and PR5 genes by regulating the OsWRKY4 protein level, and support a hypothesis that brassinosteroid and jasmonic acid cooperate to maintain the balance between growth and defense responses
