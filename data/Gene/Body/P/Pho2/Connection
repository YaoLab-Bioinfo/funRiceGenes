OsTrx23|OsTRXh1	Pho2	Two h-Type Thioredoxins Interact with the E2 Ubiquitin Conjugase PHO2 to Fine-Tune Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice.	Characterization of rice pho2 complemented lines, transformed with an endogenous genomic OsPHO2 or OsPHO2(C445S) (a constitutively reduced form) fragment, indicated that OsPHO2(C445S) restored Pi concentration in rice to statistically significant lower levels compared to native OsPHO2 Moreover, the suppression of OsTrxh1 (knockdown and knockout) resulted in slightly higher Pi concentration than that of wild-type Nipponbare in leaves
LTN1|OsPHO2|OsRLS1	Pho2	Molecular interaction between PHO2 and GI in rice.	 A yeast-two-hybrid screen using Oryza sativa (rice) PHO2 as bait, revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and OsGIGANTEA, a key regulator of flowering time, which was confirmed using bimolecular flourescenec complementation (BiFC)
