Gene-rml1.pdf	Transcript abundance of rml1, encoding a putative GT1-like factor in rice, is up-regulated by Magnaporthe grisea and down-regulated by light	2004	Gene	National Center for Gene Research, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 500 Caobao Road, Shanghai 200233, China.	We isolated and sequenced both genomic DNA and cDNA clones, which encoded a putative GT1-like protein with 385 amino acids, from cultivated rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica). This protein shows significant amino acid sequence similarities with trihelix DNA-binding GT-1a/B2F and GT-1 factors that were identified in dicot plants. Northern blotting analysis indicated that the transcript of the rice GT-1 factor in seedling was up-regulated by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea, down-regulated by various continuous light conditions and expressed rhythmically in light/dark cycles. This GT1-like factor gene was therefore designated as rml1 (rice gene regulated by M. grisea and light). The putative RML1 protein, encoded by this single copy gene, is thus identified as a new member of the plant-specific GT family of transcription factors in rice.
