Izawa-1994-The rice bZIP transc.pdf	The rice bZIP transcriptional activator RITA-1 is highly expressed during seed development	1994	Plant Cell	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Biology, Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10021-6399.	Systematic protein-DNA binding studies have shown that plant basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins exhibit a differential binding specificity for ACGT motifs. Here, we show that the rice transcription activator-1 (RITA-1) displays a broad binding specificity for palindromic ACGT elements, being able to bind A-, C-, and G-box but not T-box elements. By using gel mobility shift assays with probes differing in sequences flanking the hexameric core, we identified high-affinity A-, C-, and G-box binding sites. Quantitative and competition DNA binding studies confirmed RITA-1 specificity for these sites. Using rice protoplasts as a transient expression system, we demonstrated that RITA-1 can transactivate reporter genes possessing high-affinity but not low-affinity RITA-1 binding sites. Our results established a direct relationship between in vivo transactivation and in vitro binding activity. Transient expression assays that demonstrated the ability of RITA-1 to transactivate a construct containing rita-1 5' flanking sequences suggest that the factor may be autoregulated. Histochemical analysis of transgenic rice plants showed that a rita-1-beta-glucuronidase transgene is expressed in aleurone and endosperm cells of developing rice seeds. We propose that RITA-1 plays a role in the regulation of rice genes expressed in developing rice seeds.
J. Biol. Chem.-2001-Onodera-14139-52.pdf	A rice functional transcriptional activator, RISBZ1, responsible for endosperm-specific expression of storage protein genes through GCN4 motif	2001	J Biol Chem	Department of Biotechnology, National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The GCN4 motif, a cis-element that is highly conserved in the promoters of cereal seed storage protein genes, plays a central role in controlling endosperm-specific expression. This motif is the recognition site for a basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor that belongs to the group of maize Opaque-2 (O2)-like proteins. Five different basic leucine zipper cDNA clones, designated RISBZ1-5, have been isolated from a rice seed cDNA library. The predicted gene products can be divided into two groups based on their amino acid sequences. Although all the RISBZ proteins are able to interact with the GCN4 motif, only RISBZ1 is capable of activating (more than 100-fold expression) the expression of a reporter gene under a minimal promoter fused to a pentamer of the GCN4 motif. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments using the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain revealed that the proline-rich N-terminal domain (27 amino acids in length) is responsible for transactivation. The RISBZ1 protein is capable of forming homodimers as well as heterodimers with other RISBZ subunit proteins. RISBZ1 gene expression is restricted to the seed, where it precedes the expression of storage protein genes. When the RISBZ1 promoter was transcriptionally fused to the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene and the chimeric gene was introduced into rice, the beta-glucuronidase gene is specifically expressed in aleurone and subaleurone layer of the developing endosperm. These findings suggest that the specific expression of transcriptional activator RISBZ1 gene may determine the endosperm specificity of the storage protein genes.
Nijhawan-2008-Genomic survey and g.pdf	Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
NA	Endogenous ABA alleviates rice ammonium toxicity by reducing ROS and free ammonium via regulation of the SAPK9-bZIP20 pathway 	2020	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.	Ammonium (NH4+) is one of the principal nitrogen (N) sources in soils, but is typically toxic already at intermediate concentrations. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a pivotal role in responses to environmental stresses. However, the role of ABA under high-NH4+ stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is only marginally understood. Here, we report that elevated NH4+ can significantly accelerate tissue ABA accumulation. Mutants with high (Osaba8ox) and low levels of ABA (Osphs3-1) exhibit elevated tolerance or sensitivity to high-NH4+ stress, respectively. Furthermore, ABA can decrease NH4+-induced oxidative damage and tissue NH4+ accumulation by enhancing antioxidant and glutamine synthetase (GS)/glutamate synthetasae (GOGAT) enzyme activities. Using RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR approaches, we ascertain that two genes, OsSAPK9 and OsbZIP20, are induced both by high NH4+ and by ABA. Our data indicate that OsSAPK9 interacts with OsbZIP20, and can phosphorylate OsbZIP20 and activate its function. When OsSAPK9 or OsbZIP20 are knocked out in rice, ABA-mediated antioxidant and GS/GOGAT activity enhancement under high-NH4+ stress disappear, and the two mutants are more sensitive to high-NH4+ stress compared with their wild types. Taken together, our results suggest that ABA plays a positive role in regulating the OsSAPK9-OsbZIP20 pathway in rice to increase tolerance to high-NH4+ stress.
