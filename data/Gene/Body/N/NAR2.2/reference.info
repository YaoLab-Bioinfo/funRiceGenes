Feng-2011-Spatial expression a.pdf	Spatial expression and regulation of rice high-affinity nitrate transporters by nitrogen and carbon status	2011	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, PR China. ghxu@njau.edu.cn	The high affinity nitrate transport system (HATS) plays an important role in rice nitrogen acquisition because, even under flooded anaerobic cultivation when NH(4)(+) dominates, significant nitrification occurs on the root surface. In the rice genome, four NRT2 and two NAR2 genes encoding HATS components have been identified. One gene OsNRT2.3 was mRNA spliced into OsNRT2.3a and OsNRT2.3b and OsNAR2.1 interacts with OsNRT2.1/2.2 and OsNRT2.3a to provide nitrate uptake. Using promoter-GUS reporter plants and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses, it was observed that OsNAR2.1 was expressed mainly in the root epidermal cells, differently from the five OsNRT2 genes. OsNAR2.1, OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2, and OsNRT2.3a were up-regulated by nitrate and suppressed by NH(4)(+) and high root temperature (37 degrees C). Expression of all these genes was increased by light or external sugar supply. Root transcripts of OsNRT2.3b and OsNRT2.4 were much less abundant and not affected by temperature. Expression of OsNRT2.3b was insensitive to the form of N supply. Expression of OsNRT2.4 responded to changes in auxin supply unlike all the other NRT2 genes. A region from position -311 to -1, relative to the translation start site in the promoter region of OsNAR2.1, was found to contain the cis-element(s) necessary for the nitrate-, but not light- and sugar-dependent activation. However, it was difficult to define a conserved cis-element in the promoters of the nitrate-regulated OsNRT2/OsNAR2 genes. The results imply distinct physiological functions for each OsNRT2 transporter, and differential regulation pathways by N and C status.

Plants take up both nitrate and ammonium as main nitrogen (N) sources. Although ammonium is the predominant form in anaerobic-flooded paddy soil, it has been proposed that rice and other wetland plants may take up significant amounts of nitrate formed by nitrification of ammonium in the rhizosphere. A two-component system for nitrate transport including NRT2s with a partner protein (NAR2 or NRT3.1) has been identified in Arabidopsis. We report the physiological function of another member of the NAR2 family, OsNAR2.1 in rice (Oryza sativa, ssp. Japonica, cv. Nipponbare). OsNAR2.1 was mainly expressed in roots and induced by nitrate and suppressed by ammonium and some amino acids. Knockdown of OsNAR2.1 by RNA interference synchronously suppressed expression of OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2 and OsNRT2.3a in the osnar2.1mutants. Both high- and low-affinity nitrate transports were greatly impaired by OsNAR2.1 knockdown. Yeast two hybridization showed that OsNAR2.1 not only interacted with OsNRT2.1/OsNRT2.2, but also with OsNRT2.3a. Taken together, the data demonstrate that OsNAR2.1 plays a key role in enabling the plant to cope with variable nitrate supply.
Takayanagi-2011-High-affinity nitrat.pdf	High-affinity nitrate uptake by rice (Oryza sativa) coleoptiles	2011	J Plant Res	Graduate School of Environmental Science, University of Shiga Prefecture, 2500 Hassaka-cho, Hikone, Shiga 522-8533, Japan.	Nitrate uptake by rice coleoptiles was evaluated using (1)(5)N-nitrate in relation to the expression of high-affinity nitrate uptake-related genes, OsNRT2s (OsNRT2.1-2.4) and OsNAR2s (OsNAR2.1 and 2.2). Apparent nitrate uptake by coleoptiles was about one-sixth of that by hydroponically cultured seedling roots. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsNRT2.1, a root-specific key gene of inducible high-affinity transport system for nitrate, was most strongly induced in coleoptiles following nitrate supply initiation, while other OsNRT2s and OsNAR2s showed modest induction. These results suggest that rice coleoptiles may have high-affinity transport systems for nitrate similar to roots, and can be model organs for nutrient uptake by submerged plant shoots.
NA	OsNAR2.2 plays a vital role in the root growth and development by promoting nitrate uptake and signaling in rice.	2020	Plant Physiol Biochem	Key Laboratory of Biorheological Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Bioengineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400030, PR China.	Plants in soil faces great fluctuations of external mineral nutrient availability, and they have developed sophisticated nutrient sensing systems to regulate their physiological responses to prevent nutrient deficiency. However, complete knowledge of the regulatory system is required to maximize inorganic nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization. In this study, we report a partner protein for high-affinity nitrate transport, OsNAR2.2. OsNAR2.2 was involved in the root growth in a nitrate-dependent manner in rice, and this process was closely associated with auxin. Expression analysis showed that OsNAR2.2 responded to nitrate and various plant hormone signals. Knockdown of OsNAR2.2 by T-DNA insertion not only significantly repressed the primary root elongation, but also severely reduced the number of lateral root and adventitious root. Further research indicated that the size of meristematic zone and epidermal cell length of mature zone in the primary root tip were remarkably reduced, and the formation of lateral root primordial was constrained in osnar2.2 mutant. Interestingly, the repression of root growth in osnar2.2 mutant was observed when NO3- but not NH4+ was used as N source in the medium. The NO3- content in osnar2.2 root was significantly reduced under NO3- conditions, in comparison with that of wild type. Meanwhile, the free IAA accumulation as well as the expression of auxin biosynthesis and transport genes was altered in osnar2.2 root, suggesting there might be a crosslink between the nitrate and auxin signaling. Together, OsNAR2.2 plays a vital role in rice root growth and development in a nitrate-dependent manner, which might be associated with auxin signaling.
