Macovei-2012-microRNAs targeting.pdf	microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2012	BMC Plant Biol	Plant Molecular Biology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.	BACKGROUND: Rice (Oryza sativa L.), one of the most important food crop in the world, is considered to be a salt-sensitive crop. Excess levels of salt adversely affect all the major metabolic activities, including cell wall damage, cytoplasmic lysis and genomic stability. In order to cope with salt stress, plants have evolved high degrees of developmental plasticity, including adaptation via cascades of molecular networks and changes in gene expression profiles. Posttranscriptional regulation, through the activity of microRNAs, also plays an important role in the plant response to salinity conditions. MicroRNAs are small endogenous RNAs that modulate gene expression and are involved in the most essential physiological processes, including plant development and adaptation to environmental changes. RESULTS: In the present study, we investigated the expression profiles of osa-MIR414, osa-MIR408 and osa-MIR164e along with their targeted genes, under salinity stress conditions in wild type and transgenic rice plants ectopically expressing the PDH45 (Pea DNA Helicase) gene. The present miRNAs were predicted to target the OsABP (ATP-Binding Protein), OsDSHCT (DOB1/SK12/helY-like DEAD-box Helicase) and OsDBH (DEAD-Box Helicase) genes, included in the DEAD-box helicase family. An in silico characterization of the proteins was performed and the miRNAs predicted targets were validated by RLM-5'RACE. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT genes were up-regulated in response to 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatments. The present study also highlighted an increased accumulation of the gene transcripts in wild type plants, with the exception of the OsABP mRNA which showed the highest level (15.1-fold change compared to control) in the transgenic plants treated with 200 mM NaCl. Salinity treatments also affected the expression of osa-MIR414, osa-MIR164e and osa-MIR408, found to be significantly down-regulated, although the changes in miRNA expression were limited. CONCLUSIONS: Osa-MIR414, osa-MIR164e and osa-MIR408 were experimentally validated for the first time in plants as targeting the OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT genes. Our data showed that that the genes were up-regulated and the miRNAs were down-regulated in relation to salt stress. The negative correlation between the miRNAs and their targets was proven.
NA	Conserved miR164-targeted NAC genes negatively regulate drought resistance in rice.	2014	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	MicroRNAs constitute a large group of endogenous small RNAs of ~22 nt that emerge as vital regulators, mainly by targeting mRNAs for post-transcriptional repression. Previous studies have revealed that the miR164 family in Arabidopsis is comprised of three members which guide the cleavage of the mRNAs of five NAC genes to modulate developmental processes. However, the functions of the miR164-targeted NAC genes in crops are poorly deciphered. In this study, the conserved features of six miR164-targeted NAC genes (OMTN1-OMTN6) in rice are described, and evidence is provided that four of them confer a negative regulatory role in drought resistance. OMTN proteins have the characteristics of typical NAC transcriptional factors. The miR164 recognition sites of the OMTN genes are highly conserved in rice germplasms. Deletion of the recognition sites impaired the transactivation activity, indicating that the conserved recognition sites play a crucial role in maintaining the function of the OMTN proteins. The OMTN genes were responsive to abiotic stresses, and showed diverse spatio-temporal expression patterns in rice. Overexpression of OMTN2, OMTN3, OMTN4, and OMTN6 in rice led to negative effects on drought resistance at the reproductive stage. The expression of numerous genes related to stress response, development, and metabolism was altered in OMTN2-, OMTN3-, OMTN4-, and OMTN6-overexpressing plants. Most of the up-regulated genes in the OMTN-overexpressing plants were down-regulated by drought stress. The results suggest that the conserved miR164-targeted NAC genes may be negative regulators of drought tolerance in rice, in addition to their reported roles in development.
NA	The osa-miR164 target OsCUC1 functions redundantly with OsCUC3 in controlling rice meristem/organ boundary specification	2020	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530005, China.	The specification of the meristem/organ boundary is critical for plant development. Here, we investigate two previously uncharacterized NAC transcription factors: the first, OsCUC1, which is negatively regulated by osa-miR164c, dimerizes with the second, OsCUC3, and functions partially redundantly in meristem/organ boundary specification in rice (Oryza sativa). We produced knockout lines for rice OsCUC1 (the homolog of Arabidopsis CUC1 and CUC2) and OsCUC3 (the homolog of Arabidopsis CUC3), as well as an overexpression line for osa-miR164c, to study the molecular mechanism of boundary specification in rice. A single mutation in either OsCUC1 or OsCUC3 leads to defects in the establishment of the meristem/organ boundary, resulting in reduced stamen numbers and the fusion of leaves and filaments, and the defects are greatly enhanced in the double mutant. Transgenic plants overexpressing osa-miR164c showed a phenotype similar to that of the OsCUC1 knockout line. In addition, knockout of OsCUC1 leads to multiple defects, including dwarf plant architecture, male sterility and twisted-rolling leaves. Further study indicated that OsCUC1 physically interacts with leaf-rolling related protein CURLED LEAF AND DWARF 1 (CLD1) and stabilizes it in the nucleus to control leaf morphology. This work demonstrated that the interplay of osa-miR164c, OsCUC1 and OsCUC3 controls boundary specification in rice.
